In future iterations of this guideline, we will optimize it by soliciting and incorporating comments from a broader group of experts from CAM societies. Secondly, in the development of PRISMA-M 2020, we did not include a large-scale user-based survey to test the practicality of each item. As the value of a guideline ultimately depends on its use, we will collect broad feedback from potential users (e.g., authors, editors, and reviewers of SRs) and update it accordingly.
