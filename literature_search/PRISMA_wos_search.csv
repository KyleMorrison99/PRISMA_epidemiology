As well as positive outcome studies being preferentially published or followed by full text publication authors are also more likely to publish positive results in English-language journals. This unequal distribution of trials leads to a selection bias in evidence I level studies, like systematic reviews, meta-analysis or health technology assessments followed by a systematic failure of interpretation and in clinical decisions. Publication bias in a systematic review occurs mostly during the selection process and a transparent selection process is necessary to avoid such bias. For systematic reviews/meta-analysis the PRISMA-statement (formerly known as QUOROM) is recommended, as it gives the reader for a better understanding of the selection process. In the future the use of trial registration for minimizing publication bias, mechanisms to allow easier access to the scientific literature and improvement in the peer review process are recommended to overcome publication bias. The use of checklists like PRISMA is likely to improve the reporting quality of a systematic review and provides substantial transparency in the selection process of papers in a systematic review.

Observational studies principally encompass cohort, case-control, case series and cross-sectional designs. Inadequate reporting of observational studies is likely to have a negative impact on decision-making in day-to-day clinical practice; however, no reporting guidelines have been published for observational studies in Endodontics. The aim of this project is to develop reporting guidelines for authors when creating manuscripts describing observational studies in the field of Endodontology in an attempt to improve the quality of publications. The new guidelines for observational studies will be named: 'Preferred Reporting items for OBservational studies in Endodontics (PROBE)'. A steering committee was formed by the project leaders (PD, VN) to develop the guidelines through a five-phase consensus process. The steering committee will review and adapt items from the STrengthening the Reporting of OBservational studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) statement and the Clinical and Laboratory Images in Publications (CLIP) principles, as well as identify new items that add value to Endodontics. The steering committee will create a PROBE Delphi Group (PDG), consisting of 30 members across the globe to review and refine the draft checklist items and flowchart. The items will be assessed by the PDG on a nine-point Likert scale for relevance and inclusion. The agreed items will then be discussed by a PROBE Face-to-Face meeting group (PFMG) made up of 20 individuals to further refine the guidelines. After receiving feedback from the PFMG, the steering committee will pilot and finalize the guidelines. The approved PROBE guidelines will be disseminated through publication in relevant journals, and be presented at national and international conferences. The PROBE checklist and flowchart will be available and downloadable from the Preferred Reporting Items for study Designs in Endodontics (PRIDE) website: . The PROBE steering committee encourages clinicians, researchers, editors and peer reviewers to provide feedback on the PROBE guidelines to inform the steering group when the guidelines are updated.","[Nagendrababu, V.] Int Med Univ, Sch Dent, Div Clin Dent, Kuala Lumpur 57000, Malaysia; [Duncan, H.

However, it is recognized that despite the existence of various guidelines, for example, the Consolidated Standards for Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement, the quality of manuscripts describing randomized trials is often suboptimal. The current project aims to develop and disseminate new guidelines, Preferred Reporting Items for RAndomized Trials in Endodontics (PRIRATE), to improve the planning and reporting quality of randomized trials in the field of Endodontics. The project leads (VN, PD) designed a robust process to develop the PRIRATE guidelines. At first, a steering committee of eight members, including the project leads, was formed. Thereafter, a five-stage consensus process will be followed: initial steps, pre-meeting activities, face-to-face consensus meeting, post-meeting activities and post-publication activities. The steering committee will develop the first draft of the PRIRATE guidelines by identifying relevant and important items from various sources including the CONSORT guidelines and the Clinical and Laboratory Images in Publications (CLIP) principles. This will be followed by the establishment of a PRIRATE Delphi Group (PDG) consisting of 30 members. The individual items of the first draft of the PRIRATE guidelines developed by the steering committee will be evaluated and scored on a 9-point Likert scale by the PDG members. Items with a score of seven and above by more than 70% of PDG members will be included in the second draft of the guidelines, and the Delphi process will be repeated until each item fulfils the set conditions. After obtaining consensus from the PDG, the PRIRATE guidelines will be discussed by 20 selected individuals within a PRIRATE Face-to-face Consensus Meeting Group (PFCMG) to arrive at a final consensus. The final PRIRATE guidelines will be accompanied with an explanation and elaboration document developed by the steering committee and approved by six members, three from the PDG and three from the PFCMG. The PRIRATE guidelines will be published in journals and actively disseminated to educational institutions, national and international academic societies and presented at scientific meetings.

Evidence documenting the existence of selective reporting and excessive duplication of reviews on the same or similar topics is accumulating and many calls have been made in support of the documentation and public availability of review protocols. Several efforts have emerged in recent years to rectify these problems, including development of an international register for prospective reviews (PROSPERO) and launch of the first open access journal dedicated to the exclusive publication of systematic review products, including protocols (BioMed Central's Systematic Reviews). Furthering these efforts and building on the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses) guidelines, an international group of experts has created a guideline to improve the transparency, accuracy, completeness, and frequency of documented systematic review and meta-analysis protocols-PRISMA-P (for protocols) 2015. The PRISMA-P checklist contains 17 items considered to be essential and minimum components of a systematic review or meta-analysis protocol. This PRISMA-P 2015 Explanation and Elaboration paper provides readers with a full understanding of and evidence about the necessity of each item as well as a model example from an existing published protocol.

The MAPS (MApping onto Preference-based measures reporting Standards) statement is a new checklist that aims to promote complete and transparent reporting of mapping studies. Methods. In the absence of previously published reporting checklists or reporting guidance documents, a de novo list of reporting items was created by a working group comprised of 6 health economists and 1 Delphi methodologist. A 2-round, modified Delphi survey with representatives from academia, consultancy, health technology assessment agencies, and the biomedical journal editorial community was used to identify a list of essential reporting items from this larger list.

These studies compare the relative diagnostic strength of the test or device with a reference standard, therefore, guiding clinical decisions on the reliability of the test, the need for further tests, and whether to monitor or treat a particular condition. Inadequate and incomplete reporting of diagnostic accuracy studies can disguise methodological deficiencies and ultimately result in study bias and the inability to translate research findings into daily clinical practice. The Preferred Reporting Items for Diagnostic Accuracy Studies in Endodontics (PRIDASE) guidelines are being developed in order to improve the accuracy, transparency, completeness and reproducibility of diagnostic accuracy studies in the speciality of Endodontology. The aim of this paper is to report the process used to develop the PRIDASE guidelines based on a well-established consensus process. The project leaders (PD, VN) formed a steering committee of nine members (PD, VN, PA, AF, DR, SP, CK, MP, HD) to oversee and manage the project. The PRIDASE steering committee will develop the initial draft of the PRIDASE guidelines by adapting and modifying the Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (STARD) 2015 guidelines, adding new items related specifically to the nature of Endodontics and incorporate the Clinical and Laboratory Images in Publication (CLIP) principles. The initial guidelines will consist of a series of domains and individual items and will be validated by the members of a PRIDASE Delphi Group (PDG) consisting of a minimum of 30 individuals who will evaluate independently the individual items based on two parameters: 'clarity' using a dichotomous scoring (yes/no) and 'suitability' for inclusion using a 9-point Likert Scale. The scores awarded by each member and any suggestions for improvement will be shared with the PDG to inform an iterative process that will result in a series of items that are clear and suitable for inclusion in the new PRIDASE guidelines. Once the PDG has completed its work, the steering committee will create a PRIDASE Meeting Group (PMG) of 20 individuals from around the world. Members of the PDG will be eligible to be the part of PMG. The draft guidelines and flowchart approved by the PDG will then be presented for further validation and agreement by the PMG. As a result of these discussions, the PRIDASE guidelines will be finalized and then disseminated to relevant stakeholders through publications and via the Preferred Reporting Items for study Designs in Endodontology (PRIDE) website (). Periodic updates to the PRIDASE guidelines will be made based on feedback from stakeholders and end-users.","[Nagendrababu, V.] Univ Sharjah, Coll Dent Med, Dept Prevent & Restorat Dent, Sharjah, U Arab Emirates; [Abbott, P.] Univ Western Australia, UWA Dent Sch, Nedlands, WA, Australia; [Duncan, H.

Meta-analyses can resolve long-standing disputes, dispel spurious claims, and generate new research questions. At their worst, however, meta-analysis publications are wolves in sheep's clothing: subjective with biased conclusions, hidden under coats of objective authority. Conclusions can be rendered unreliable by inappropriate statistical methods, problems with the methods used to select primary research, or problems within the primary research itself. Because of these risks, meta-analyses are increasingly conducted as part of systematic reviews, which use structured, transparent, and reproducible methods to collate and summarise evidence. For readers to determine whether the conclusions from a systematic review or meta-analysis should be trusted - and to be able to build upon the review - authors need to report what they did, why they did it, and what they found. Complete, transparent, and reproducible reporting is measured by 'reporting quality'. To assess perceptions and standards of reporting quality of systematic reviews and meta-analyses published in ecology and evolutionary biology, we surveyed 208 researchers with relevant experience (as authors, reviewers, or editors), and conducted detailed evaluations of 102 systematic review and meta-analysis papers published between 2010 and 2019. Reporting quality was far below optimal and approximately normally distributed. Measured reporting quality was lower than what the community perceived, particularly for the systematic review methods required to measure trustworthiness. The minority of assessed papers that referenced a guideline (similar to 16%) showed substantially higher reporting quality than average, and surveyed researchers showed interest in using a reporting guideline to improve reporting quality. The leading guideline for improving reporting quality of systematic reviews is the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. Here we unveil an extension of PRISMA to serve the meta-analysis community in ecology and evolutionary biology: PRISMA-EcoEvo (version 1.0). PRISMA-EcoEvo is a checklist of 27 main items that, when applicable, should be reported in systematic review and meta-analysis publications summarising primary research in ecology and evolutionary biology. In this explanation and elaboration document, we provide guidance for authors, reviewers, and editors, with explanations for each item on the checklist, including supplementary examples from published papers. Authors can consult this PRISMA-EcoEvo guideline both in the planning and writing stages of a systematic review and meta-analysis, to increase reporting quality of submitted manuscripts. Reviewers and editors can use the checklist to assess reporting quality in the manuscripts they review. Overall, PRISMA-EcoEvo is a resource for the ecology and evolutionary biology community to facilitate transparent and comprehensively reported systematic reviews and meta-analyses.","[O'Dea, Rose E.; Lagisz, Malgorzata; Nakagawa, Shinichi] Univ New South Wales, Evolut & Ecol Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [O'Dea, Rose E.; Lagisz, Malgorzata; Nakagawa, Shinichi] Univ New South Wales, Sch Biol & Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; [Jennions, Michael D.; Noble, Daniel W.

This study describes a unified platform with Preferred Reporting Items for the Development of Evidence-based CPGs in TM (PRIDE-CPG-TM), which has been successfully used by the evidence-based CPGs committee for TM. Methods: Initially we searched the literature and CPG handbooks, collected items from methodology references and drew on experiences gained from Korean medical physicians and methodology experts. A group of experts subsequently edited drafts of the items, identified one or more examples of good reporting for each item, and developed text that explained the rationale and discussed relevant evidence. Face to face meetings were held with experts to finalize the items with the most extensive elaboration. Results: The PRIDE-CPG-TM, in the form of a checklist and description of items with TM approach and TM examples, were designed to improve the reporting of CPG in TM and thereby facilitate their interpretation and replication. The PRIDE-CPG-TM included 5 domains and 40 items. The items pertain to the development methodology (22 items), Overview of diseases and symptoms (6 items), Recommendations (4 items), Implementation and dissemination (5 items) and others (3 items). Conclusions: The completeness of CPG descriptions in TM is very poor. Therefore, a complete description of the recommendations for TM in CPGs is necessary for physicians to implement the recommendations in clinical practice areas. The PRIDE-CPG-TM will provide useful guidance for TM developers in the development of evidence-based CPGs. (C) 2016 The Author(s).

They are likely to be used with increasing frequency as current initiatives to share clinical trial data gain momentum and may be particularly important in reviewing controversial therapeutic areas. OBJECTIVE To develop PRISMA-IPD as a stand-alone extension to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) Statement, tailored to the specific requirements of reporting systematic reviews and meta-analyses of IPD. Although developed primarily for reviews of randomized trials, many items will apply in other contexts, including reviews of diagnosis and prognosis. DESIGN Development of PRISMA-IPD followed the EQUATOR Network framework guidance and used the existing standard PRISMA Statement as a starting point to draft additional relevant material. A web-based survey informed discussion at an international workshop that included researchers, clinicians, methodologists experienced in conducting systematic reviews and meta-analyses of IPD, and journal editors. The statement was drafted and iterative refinements were made by the project, advisory, and development groups. The PRISMA-IPD Development Group reached agreement on the PRISMA-IPD checklist and flow diagram by consensus. FINDINGS Compared with standard PRISMA, the PRISMA-IPD checklist includes 3 new items that address (1) methods of checking the integrity of the IPD (such as pattern of randomization, data consistency, baseline imbalance, and missing data), (2) reporting any important issues that emerge, and (3) exploring variation (such as whether certain types of individual benefit more from the intervention than others). A further additional item was created by reorganization of standard PRISMA items relating to interpreting results. Wording was modified in 23 items to reflect the IPD approach. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE PRISMA-IPD provides guidelines for reporting systematic reviews and meta-analyses of IPD.","[Stewart, Lesley A.; Simmonds, Mark; Stewart, Gavin] Univ York, Ctr Reviews & Disseminat, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England; [Clarke, Mike] Queens Univ Belfast, All Ireland Hub Trials Methodol Res, Belfast, Antrim, North Ireland; [Rovers, Maroeska] Radboudumc, Radbound Inst Hlth Sci, Nijmegen, Netherlands; [Riley, Richard D.] Keele Univ, Res Inst Primary Care & Hlth Sci, Keele ST5 5BG, Staffs, England; [Riley, Richard D.] Univ Birmingham, Sch Hlth & Populat Sci, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Stewart, Gavin] Newcastle Univ, Ctr Rural Econ, Sch Agr Food & Rural Dev, Newcastle Upon Tyne, Tyne & Wear, England; [Tierney, Jayne F.] UCL, MRC Clin Trials Unit, London, England",University of York - UK; Queens University Belfast; Radboud University Nijmegen; Keele University; University of Birmingham; Newcastle University - UK; Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Unit; University of London; University College London,"Stewart, LA (corresponding author), Univ York, Ctr Reviews & Disseminat, York YO10 5DD, N Yorkshire, England.",,"; Schmid, Christopher/J-2398-2014; Riley, Richard D/G-2406-2011; Rovers, Maroeska/F-2969-2014; Krleza-Jeric, Karmela/M-5253-2018","Stewart, Gavin/0000-0001-5684-1544; PIGNON, Jean-Pierre/0000-0003-2047-1582; Schmid, Christopher/0000-0002-0855-5313; Riley, Richard D/0000-0001-8699-0735; Rovers, Maroeska/0000-0002-3095-170X; Tudur Smith, Catrin/0000-0003-3051-1445; Emberson, Jonathan/0000-0001-7792-9422; Stewart, Lesley/0000-0003-0287-4724; Krleza-Jeric, Karmela/0000-0001-9377-0917; Tierney, Jayne/0000-0002-4734-3014","National Institute for Health Research (NIHR); MRC as part of the MRC-National Institute for Health Research Methodology Research Programme [88053]; MRC [MC_UU_12023/24, G0801402] Funding Source: UKRI",National Institute for Health Research (NIHR)(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)); MRC as part of the MRC-National Institute for Health Research Methodology Research Programme(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)),The PRISMA-IPD workshop was funded through a National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Senior Investigator personal award (Dr L.

OBJECTIVE To develop the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) diagnostic test accuracy guideline as a stand-alone extension of the PRISMA statement. Modifications to the PRISMA statement reflect the specific requirements for reporting of systematic reviews and meta-analyses of diagnostic test accuracy studies and the abstracts for these reviews. DESIGN Established standards from the Enhancing the Quality and Transparency of Health Research (EQUATOR) Network were followed for the development of the guideline. The original PRISMA statement was used as a framework on which to modify and add items. A group of 24 multidisciplinary experts used a systematic review of articles on existing reporting guidelines and methods, a 3-round Delphi process, a consensus meeting, pilot testing, and iterative refinement to develop the PRISMA diagnostic test accuracy guideline. The final version of the PRISMA diagnostic test accuracy guideline checklist was approved by the group. FINDINGS The systematic review (produced 64 items) and the Delphi process (provided feedback on 7 proposed items; 1 item was later split into 2 items) identified 71 potentially relevant items for consideration. The Delphi process reduced these to 60 items that were discussed at the consensus meeting. Following the meeting, pilot testing and iterative feedback were used to generate the 27-item PRISMA diagnostic test accuracy checklist. To reflect specific or optimal contemporary systematic review methods for diagnostic test accuracy, 8 of the 27 original PRISMA items were left unchanged, 17 were modified, 2 were added, and 2 were omitted. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The 27-item PRISMA diagnostic test accuracy checklist provides specific guidance for reporting of systematic reviews.

Systematic reviews (SRs) are essential references for evaluating the efficacy and safety of CHM treatments accurately and reliably. Unfortunately, the reporting quality of SRs with CHM is not optimal, especially the reporting of CHM interventions and the rationale of why these interventions were selected. To address this problem, a group of TCM clinical experts, methodologists, epidemiologists, and editors has developed a PRISMA extension for CHM interventions (PRISMA-CHM) through a comprehensive process, including registration, literature review, consensus meeting, three-round Delphi survey, and finalization. The PRISMA checklist was extended by introducing the concept of TCM Pattern and the characteristics of CHM interventions. A total of twenty-four items (including sub-items) are included in the checklist, relating to title (1), structured summary (2), rationale (3), objectives (4), eligibility criteria (6), data items (11), synthesis of results (14, 21), additional analyses (16, 23), study characteristics (18), summary of evidence (24), and conclusions (26).

A potential means to address the replication crisis and enhance research reliability is to improve reporting quality and transparency. This study aims to formulate a reporting checklist as a supplement to the existing reporting guidelines, specifically for resistance exercise studies.MethodsPubMed (which covers Medline) and Scopus (which covers Medline, EMBASE, Ei Compendex, World Textile Index, Fluidex, Geobase, Biobase, and most journals in Web of Science) were searched for systematic reviews that comprised the primary studies directly comparing different resistance training methods. Basic data on the selected reviews, including on authors, publication years, and objectives, were summarized. The reporting items for the checklist were identified based on the objective of the reviews. Additional items from an existing checklist, namely the Consensus on Exercise Reporting Template, a National Strength and Conditioning Association handbook, and an article from the EQUATOR library were incorporated into the final reporting checklist.ResultsOur database search retrieved 3595 relevant records. After automatic duplicate removal, the titles and abstracts of the remaining 2254 records were screened. The full texts of 137 records were then reviewed, and 88 systematic reviews that met the criteria were included in the umbrella review.ConclusionDeveloped primarily by an umbrella review method, this checklist covers the research questions which have been systematically studied and is expected to improve the reporting completeness of future resistance exercise studies. The PRIRES checklist comprises 26 reporting items (39 subitems) that cover four major topics in resistance exercise intervention: 1) exercise selection, performance, and training parameters, 2) training program and progression, 3) exercise setting, and 4) planned vs actual training. The PRIRES checklist was designed specifically for reporting resistance exercise intervention. It is expected to be used with other reporting guidelines such as Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials and Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials. This article presents only the development process and resulting items of the checklist. An accompanying article detailing the rationale for, the importance of, and examples of each item is being prepared.RegistrationThis study is registered with the EQUATOR Network under the title Preferred Reporting Items for Resistance Exercise Studies (PRIRES).

Seven extensions to the PRISMA Statement have been published to address the reporting of different types or aspects of SRs, and another eight are in development. We performed a scoping review to map the research that has been conducted to evaluate the uptake and impact of the PRISMA Statement and extensions. We also synthesised studies evaluating how well SRs published after the PRISMA Statement was disseminated adhere to its recommendations. Methods: We searched for meta-research studies indexed in MEDLINE (R) from inception to 31 July 2017, which investigated some component of the PRISMA Statement or extensions (e.g. SR adherence to PRISMA, journal endorsement of PRISMA). One author screened all records and classified the types of evidence available in the studies. We pooled data on SR adherence to individual PRISMA items across all SRs in the included studies and across SRs published after 2009 (the year PRISMA was disseminated). Results: We included 100 meta-research studies. The most common type of evidence available was data on SR adherence to the PRISMA Statement, which has been evaluated in 57 studies that have assessed 6487 SRs. The pooled results of these studies suggest that reporting of many items in the PRISMA Statement is suboptimal, even in the 2382 SRs published after 2009 (where nine items were adhered to by fewer than 67% of SRs). Few meta-research studies have evaluated the adherence of SRs to the PRISMA extensions or strategies to increase adherence to the PRISMA Statement and extensions. Conclusions: Many studies have evaluated how well SRs adhere to the PRISMA Statement, and the pooled result of these suggest that reporting of many items is suboptimal. An update of the PRISMA Statement, along with a toolkit of strategies to help journals endorse and implement the updated guideline, may improve the transparency of SRs.","[Page, Matthew J.] Monash Univ, Sch Publ Hlth & Prevent Med, 553 St Kilda Rd, Melbourne, Vic 3004, Australia; [Moher, David] Ottawa Hosp Res Inst, Ctr Journalol, Clin Epidemiol Program, Ottawa, ON K1H 8L6, Canada; [Moher, David] Ottawa Hosp Res Inst, Canadian EQUATOR Ctr, Clin Epidemiol Program, Ottawa, ON K1H 8L6, Canada; [Moher, David] Univ Ottawa, Fac Med, Sch Epidemiol & Publ Hlth, Ottawa, ON K1H 8M5, Canada",Monash University; University of Ottawa; Ottawa Hospital Research Institute; University of Ottawa; Ottawa Hospital Research Institute; University of Ottawa,"Page, MJ (corresponding author), Monash Univ, Sch Publ Hlth & Prevent Med, 553 St Kilda Rd, Melbourne, Vic 3004, Australia.",matthew.page@monash.edu,"Moher, David/I-3408-2019","Page, Matthew/0000-0002-4242-7526","Australian National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) Early Career Fellowship [1088535]; University Research Chair, University of Ottawa","Australian National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) Early Career Fellowship(National Health & Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia); University Research Chair, University of Ottawa","There was no direct funding for this study.

The primary objective of this study was to examine compliance of systematic reviews in veterinary journals with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines for literature search reporting and to examine the completeness, bias, and reproducibility of the searches in these reviews from what was reported. The second objective was to examine reporting of the credentials and contributions of those involved in the search process. Methods: A sample of systematic reviews or meta-analyses published in veterinary journals between 2011 and 2015 was obtained by searching PubMed. Reporting in the full text of each review was checked against certain PRISMA checklist items. Results: Over one-third of reviews (37%) did not search the CAB Abstracts database, and 9% of reviews searched only 1 database. Over two-thirds of reviews (65%) did not report any search for grey literature or stated that they excluded grey literature. The majority of reviews (95%) did not report a reproducible search strategy. Conclusions: Most reviews had significant deficiencies in reporting the search process that raise questions about how these searches were conducted and ultimately cast serious doubts on the validity and reliability of reviews based on a potentially biased and incomplete body of literature. These deficiencies also highlight the need for veterinary journal editors and publishers to be more rigorous in requiring adherence to PRISMA guidelines and to encourage veterinary researchers to include librarians or information specialists on systematic review teams to improve the quality and reporting of searches.","[Toews, Lorraine C.] Univ Calgary, Hlth Sci Lib, 3330 Hosp Dr Northwest, Calgary, AB T2N 4N1, Canada; [Toews, Lorraine C.] Univ Calgary, Fac Vet Med, Dept Ecosyst & Publ Hlth, 3280 Hosp Dr Northwest, Calgary, AB T2N 4Z6, Canada",University of Calgary; University of Calgary,"Toews, LC (corresponding author), Univ Calgary, Hlth Sci Lib, 3330 Hosp Dr Northwest, Calgary, AB T2N 4N1, Canada.;Toews, LC (corresponding author), Univ Calgary, Fac Vet Med, Dept Ecosyst & Publ Hlth, 3280 Hosp Dr Northwest, Calgary, AB T2N 4Z6, Canada.",ltoews@ucalgary.ca,"Toews, Lorraine/N-1848-2014","Toews, Lorraine/0000-0003-4692-0358",,,,,36,34,38,0,17,MEDICAL LIBRARY ASSOC,CHICAGO,"65 EAST WACKER PLACE, STE 1900, CHICAGO, IL 60601-7298 USA",1536-5050,,,J MED LIBR ASSOC,J.

Scientists, clinician-scientists and clinicians rely on the summary information provided in the abstracts of systematic reviews to assist in subsequent clinical decision-making. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) for s checklist was developed to improve the quality, accuracy and completeness of abstracts associated with systematic reviews and meta-analyses. The PRISMA for s checklist provides a framework for authors to follow, which helps them provide in the abstract the key information from the systematic review that is required by stakeholders. The PRISMA for s checklist contains 12 items (title, objectives, eligibility criteria, information sources, risk of bias, included studies, synthesis of results, description of the effect, strength and limitations, interpretation, funding and systematic review registration) under six sections (title, background, methods, results, discussion, other). The current article highlights the relevance and importance of the items in the PRISMA for s checklist to the specialty of Endodontology, while offering explanations and specific examples to assist authors when writing abstracts for systematic reviews when reported in manuscripts or submitted to conferences. Strict adherence to the PRISMA for s checklist by authors, reviewers and journal editors will result in the consistent publication of high-quality abstracts within Endodontology.","[Nagendrababu, V.; Pulikkotil, S.

Methodology All case reports published in the International Endodontic Journal, European Endodontic Journal, Journal of Endodontics and Restorative Dentistry and Endodontics, in the year before and after the release of PRICE 2020, were included for analysis. Two panels comprising dentists scored case reports against a scoring system adapted from the guideline. Individual items were scored up to a maximum of 1; scores were then summated to provide an overall maximum of 47 for each CR. Each report provided an overall percentage adherence, and panel agreement was calculated using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Disagreement on scoring was discussed until a consensus was reached. Scores before and after PRICE guideline publication were compared using an unpaired two-tailed t test. Results A total 19 CRs were identified in both the pre- and post-PRICE guideline publication. Mean adherence to PRICE 2020 increased by 7.9% (p=0.003) from 70.0%+/- 8.89 to 77.9%+/- 6.23 following its publication. Agreement between panels was moderate (ICC pre-PRICE: 0.673 {p=0.011}; ICC post-PRICE: 0.742 {p=0.003}). Items 1a, 6c, 6e, 6f, 6g, 6j, 6q, 6s, 7a, 9a, 11a, 12c and 12d experienced a fall in compliance. Conclusion The PRICE 2020 guideline has resulted in a modest improvement in the reporting of endodontic case reports. Greater awareness and a wider acceptance and implementation of the guideline in endodontic journals are needed to improve adherence to the novel guideline.","[Youssef, Sofian] Univ Nottingham, Acad Res, Nottingham, England; [Tomson, Phillip; Archer, Natalie; Shah, Fayjel; Heran, Jasmeet; Kandhari, Sunmeet; Pai, Sandeep; Mehrotra, Shivakar] Univ Birmingham, Endodont, Birmingham, England; [Akbari, Amir Reza] Kings Mill Hosp, Obstet & Gynecol, Mansfield, England; [Batt, Joanna M.] Univ Birmingham, Restorat Dent, Birmingham, England",University of Nottingham; University of Birmingham; University of Birmingham,"Youssef, S (corresponding author), Univ Nottingham, Acad Res, Nottingham, England.",sofian_y@hotmail.co.uk,,,,,,,49,0,0,0,1,SPRINGERNATURE,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,2168-8184,,CUREUS J MED SCIENCE,Cureus J Med Sci,APR 14,2023,15,4,,,,,,,e37553,10.7759/cureus.37553,http://dx.doi.org/10.7759/cureus.37553,,,11,"Medicine, General & Internal",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),General & Internal Medicine,U1YS6,37197127,"Green Published, gold",,,2024-11-25,WOS:001082835600002,View Full Record in Web of Science

The quality of reporting in these studies is guided by the 2015 Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Individual Participant Data (PRISMA-IPD) guidelines. The growing number of IPD-MA published for stroke studies calls for an assessment of the compliance of these studies with the PRISMA-IPD statement. Methods: PubMed and EMBASE were searched for MA in stroke published between January 1, 2016, and March 30, 2020, in journals with impact factor >2. Literature reviews, scoping reviews, and aggregate MA were excluded. The final articles were scored using the 31-item PRISMA-IPD checklist. Results were depicted using descriptive statistics. Compliance with each item in PRISM-IPD guideline was recorded. The study was defined as compliant to IPD analyses if it satisfied all IPD specific items. Results: From an initial set of 321 articles, 31 met the final eligibility for data extraction. Only 4 (13%) described the use of PRISMA-IPD guidelines in their methodology, while 8/31 (26%) used the old PRISMA guidelines and 19/31 (61%) followed none. Regardless of mention of using IPD specific guidelines, 42% (n=13) of studies were compliant with all 4 IPD specific domains. The poorest areas of compliance were bias assessment within (32%) and across (39%) studies, reporting protocol and registration (42%), and reporting of IPD integrity (48%). The median journal impact factor was similar between the compliant (median, 8.1 [interquartile range, 5.4-39.9]) and noncompliant (median, 6 [interquartile range, 4.5-16.2]) groups (P=0.24). Similarly, the journal, country of correspondence, number of authors, number of studies included in MA, study sample size, and funding source were statistically similar between the groups. Conclusions: For the published IPD-MA stroke studies, the compliance with PRISMA-IPD statement and compliance with 4 IPD specific items was suboptimal. The journal, author, and study-related factors were not associated with compliance. Additional scrutiny measures to ensure adherence to mandated guidelines might increase the compliance. Several avenues to improve compliance and ensure optimal adherence are discussed.","[Jumah, Fareed; Ashraf, Omar; Rallo, Michael S.; Raju, Bharath; Gadhiya, Arjun; Sun, Hai; Narayan, Vinayak; Gupta, Gaurav; Nanda, Anil] Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Med Sch & Univ Hosp, Dept Neurosurg, New Brunswick, NJ USA; [Chotai, Silky] Vanderbilt Univ, Med Ctr, Dept Neurosurg, Nashville, TN USA",Vanderbilt University,"Nanda, A (corresponding author), Rutgers New Jersey Med Sch, Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Med Sch, Dept Neurosurg, New Brunswick, NJ 08901 USA.",an651@rwjms.rutgers.edu,"Gupta, Gaurav/AAL-3349-2020; Raju, Bharath/AAR-8784-2021; Sun, Hai/Z-3229-2019; Jumah, Fareed/AAG-7529-2020","Gupta, Gaurav/0000-0002-9442-6007; Rallo, Michael/0000-0002-8370-3486; Sun, Hai/0000-0001-8878-8776; Raju, Bharath/0000-0002-4897-2939",,,,,52,1,1,0,1,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",0039-2499,1524-4628,,STROKE,Stroke,SEP,2021,52,9,,,,,2817,2826,,10.1161/STROKEAHA.120.033288,http://dx.doi.org/10.1161/STROKEAHA.120.033288,,,10,Clinical Neurology; Peripheral Vascular Disease,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Neurosciences & Neurology; Cardiovascular System & Cardiology,UE3XD,34082573,Bronze,,,2024-11-25,WOS:000687824000025,View Full Record in Web of Science

Despite their increasing popularity, there are currently no systematically developed reporting guidelines for overviews. This is problematic because the reporting of published overviews varies considerably and is often substandard. Our objective is to use explicit, systematic, and transparent methods to develop an evidence-based and agreement-based reporting guideline for overviews of reviews of healthcare interventions (PRIOR, Preferred Reporting Items for Overviews of Reviews). Methods We will develop the PRIOR reporting guideline in four stages, using established methods for developing reporting guidelines in health research. First, we will establish an international and multidisciplinary expert advisory board that will oversee the conduct of the project and provide methodological support. Second, we will use the results of comprehensive literature reviews to develop a list of prospective checklist items for the reporting guideline. Third, we will use a modified Delphi exercise to achieve a high level of expert agreement on the list of items to be included in the PRIOR reporting guideline. We will identify and recruit a group of up to 100 international experts who will provide input into the guideline in three Delphi rounds: the first two rounds will occur via online survey, and the third round will occur during a smaller (8 to 10 participants) in-person meeting that will use a nominal group technique. Fourth, we will produce and publish the PRIOR reporting guideline. Discussion A systematically developed reporting guideline for overviews could help to improve the accuracy, completeness, and transparency of overviews. This, in turn, could help maximize the value and impact of overviews by allowing more efficient interpretation and use of their research findings.","[Pollock, Michelle] Inst Hlth Econ, 1200 10405 Jasper Ave, Edmonton, AB T5J 3N4, Canada; [Fernandes, Ricardo M.] Univ Lisbon, Fac Med, Clin Pharmacol Unit, Inst Med Mol, Av Prof Egas Moniz, P-1649028 Lisbon, Portugal; [Fernandes, Ricardo M.] Santa Maria Hosp, Dept Pediat, Lisbon, Portugal; [Pieper, Dawid] Univ Witten Herdecke, Dept Humanmed, Inst Forsch Operat Med, Witten, Germany; [Tricco, Andrea C.] St Michaels Hosp, Li Ka Shing Knowledge Inst, 209 Victoria St, Toronto, ON M5B 1T8, Canada; [Tricco, Andrea C.] Univ Toronto, Dalla Lana Sch Publ Hlth, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Tricco, Andrea C.] Univ Toronto, Inst Hlth Policy Management & Evaluat, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Tricco, Andrea C.] Queens Univ, Queens Collaborat Hlth Care Qual Joanna Briggs In, Ctr Excellence, Kingston, ON, Canada; [Gates, Michelle; Gates, Allison; Hartling, Lisa] Univ Alberta, Edmonton Clin Hlth Acad 4 482C, Alberta Res Ctr Hlth Evidence, Dept Pediat, 11405-87 Ave NW, Edmonton, AB T6G 1C9, Canada",Universidade de Lisboa; Universidade de Lisboa; Hospital Santa Maria; Witten Herdecke University; University of Toronto; Saint Michaels Hospital Toronto; Li Ka Shing Knowledge Institute; University of Toronto; University of Toronto; Queens University - Canada; University of Alberta,"Hartling, L (corresponding author), Univ Alberta, Edmonton Clin Hlth Acad 4 482C, Alberta Res Ctr Hlth Evidence, Dept Pediat, 11405-87 Ave NW, Edmonton, AB T6G 1C9, Canada.",hartling@ualberta.ca,"Fernandes, Ricardo/C-7501-2015; Tricco, Andrea/B-9920-2011; Pieper, Dawid/P-1014-2016",,Tier 2 Canada Research Chair in knowledge synthesis; Tier 1 Canada Research Chair in knowledge synthesis and translation,Tier 2 Canada Research Chair in knowledge synthesis; Tier 1 Canada Research Chair in knowledge synthesis and translation,There is no specific funding for this project.

Scope and approach: The Web of Science database was searched for studies published between 2014 and 2019 using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines in order to investigate the relationship between RBPHs and functional/health outcomes. The aim of this review is to reinforce and summarise the protective role of RBPHs as an antioxidant, an antidiabetic agent and an Angiotensinconverting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor with other nutritional properties and functional properties. Key findings and conclusions: RBP cleaved by different enzymes produces low molecular weight (MW) antioxidant peptides with radical scavenging activity and metal chelation power. These peptides restrain ACE activity and significantly reduce the intracellular ACE levels in rodent models. These peptides are also antidiabetic as they inhibit amylase, ?- and ?-glucosidase and dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV). They also suppress intracellular glutathione (GSH) levels by down-regulating the expression of a variety of inflammatory factors including 2 (Nrf2), quinone oxidoreductase1 (NQO1) and hemeoxygenase 1 (HO-1). The health promoting effects of antimelanogenesis, antimicrobial, and iron availability enhancement are described. Plus, RBPHs fortified food shows better preservation against lipid oxidation. Nowadays, turning rice mill wastes into the more manageable and sustainable applications has received attentions for their nutritional and functional properties rather than only animal feeds and a source of the biomass fuel. But the application of the rice bran for nutritional purposes is still limited. The high cost of the enzymes and the sensitive nature of peptides are the major industrial concerns. It is expected that the number of rice bran products and their acceptance will increase in the future market.","[Gong, Xi; Sui, Limin; Morton, James; Brennan, Margaret Anne; Brennan, Charles Stephen] Lincoln Univ, Fac Agr & Life Sci, Dept Wine Food & Mol Biosci, Christchurch 7647, New Zealand; [Gong, Xi; Sui, Limin; Brennan, Charles Stephen] Massey Univ, Ridett Inst, Private Bag 11 222, Palmerston North 4442, New Zealand; [Brennan, Charles Stephen] RMIT, Sch Sci, Melbourne, Vic, Australia",Lincoln University - New Zealand; Massey University; Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT),"Brennan, CS (corresponding author), Lincoln Univ, Fac Agr & Life Sci, Dept Wine Food & Mol Biosci, Christchurch 7647, New Zealand.",xi.gong@lincolnuni.ac.nz; charles.brennan@lincoln.ac.nz,"Morton, James/C-6149-2012; Brennan, Charles/E-4135-2012","Brennan, Charles/0000-0003-2479-8478; Gong, Xi/0000-0003-2863-4171; Sui, Limin/0000-0003-1552-5849",,,,,65,18,18,6,75,ELSEVIER SCIENCE LONDON,LONDON,"84 THEOBALDS RD, LONDON WC1X 8RR, ENGLAND",0924-2244,1879-3053,,TRENDS FOOD SCI TECH,Trends Food Sci.

Despite the prevalent use of the PRISMA statement in medicine and nursing, no studies have examined authors' perception of it. The purpose of this study is to explore the perception of the PRISMA statement of authors who published reviews, meta-analyses, or both in nursing journals. Design Cross-sectional descriptive study. Methods An online survey was conducted among authors who published reviews, meta-analyses, or both in nursing journals between 2011 and 2017. The selected authors' email addresses were extracted from the PUBMED database. A questionnaire-with a 10-point Likert scale (1-not important at all to 10-very important)-was developed to elicit their responses regarding their perception of not only the PRISMA statement as a whole, but also the individual items therein. Results Invitations were sent to 1960 valid email addresses identified, with 230 responses (response rate: 11.7%) and 181 completed responses (completion rate: 9.2%). The average perceived importance of the PRISMA statement was 8.66 (SD=1.35), while the perceived importance for the individual items ranged from 7.74 to 9.32. Six items were rated significantly higher than the average rating, whereas one item was rated significantly lower. Conclusion Most respondents perceived the PRISMA statement as important. Items related to information sources, selection, search-flow presentation, summary of findings, limitations and interpretation were deemed more important while the registration was deemed less so.","[Tam, Wilson W.

The aim of this paper was to offer a pilot version checklist with Preferred Reporting Items for OoSRs (PRIO-harms) to promote a more balanced reporting of benefits and harms in OoSRs of health care interventions. Study Design and Setting: The included items were developed by combining key features from health care OoSRs designs with recommendations from statements of other relevant checklists and pertinent methodological review articles. Two raters independently used the PRIO-harms checklist to assess a sample of 20 OoSRs. Results: The PRIO-harms tool consists of a 27-item (56 (sub-)items in total) checklist and is accompanied by a five-stage process flow diagram (identification, screening, eligibility, inclusion, and separation of relevant studies). The mean interrater reliability (Gwet's AC1 statistic) between reviewers was 0.90 (95% confidence interval: 0.88, 0.92) indicating a very good agreement. Conclusion: The PRIO-harms tool can be used in every OoSRs that addresses health care interventions. This instrument will assist overview authors to improve completeness and transparency of research reporting with emphasis on harms. However, it might benefit from critical review and further validation from experts and research teams that produce OoSRs. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Therefore, these studies should be conducted and reported according to the mandatory Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. This study evaluated compliance with the PRISMA guidelines for conducting and reporting systematic reviews in three major periodontology journals.Material and Methods A hand search was conducted in three major periodontal journals to identify Systematic Reviews (SRs) published between January 2018 and July 2022 using the words Systematic Review or meta-analysis in the title, abstract, or methodology of an article. The PRISMA statement checklist was used to evaluate eligible SRs, covering various sections of the review process. Descriptive statistics, univariate and multivariate analyses, and inter-examiner and intra-examiner reliability assessments were conducted for data analysis.Results A total of 87 SRs with meta-analyses were included in the current study. The proportion of published systematic reviews during the investigation period was 5.7% of the total published articles. 16 items were reported adequately in less than 75% of the included papers. Notably, items such as abstracts, data items, sensitivity analysis methods, synthesis results, reporting biases, evidence certainty, registration and protocol, data, code, and other materials availability were reported inadequately in some reviews.Conclusion The findings from this study support previous research demonstrating that compliance with the PRISMA guidelines for the conduct and reporting of systematic reviews can vary, potentially attributing to a lack of understanding regarding these guidelines and their clinical significance.","[Alharbi, Fahad; Gufran, Khalid; Alqerban, Ali; Alqahtani, Abdullah Saad] Prince Sattam Bin Abdulaziz Univ, Coll Dent, Dept Prevent Dent Sci, Al Kharj 11942, Saudi Arabia; [Asiri, Saeed N.] Prince Sattam Bin Abdulaziz Univ, Al Kharj 11942, Saudi Arabia; [Almutairi, Abdullah] Qassim Univ Saudi Arabia, Coll Dent, Dept Periodontol & Implant Dent, Buraydah, Saudi Arabia",Prince Sattam Bin Abdulaziz University; Prince Sattam Bin Abdulaziz University; Qassim University,"Gufran, K (corresponding author), Prince Sattam Bin Abdulaziz Univ, Coll Dent, Dept Prevent Dent Sci, Al Kharj 11942, Saudi Arabia.",k.syed@psau.edu.sa,"Alharbi, Fahad/GVS-8969-2022; Gufran, Khalid/ABG-4312-2020","Alharbi, Fahad/0000-0002-2083-1528; Gufran, Khalid/0000-0001-9623-559X",,,,,39,0,0,0,0,BENTHAM SCIENCE PUBL LTD,SHARJAH,"EXECUTIVE STE Y-2, PO BOX 7917, SAIF ZONE, 1200 BR SHARJAH, U ARAB EMIRATES",1874-2106,,,OPEN DENT J,Open Dent.

Our aim was to evaluate the impact of PRISMA endorsement on the quality of reporting and methodological quality of systematic reviews and meta-analyses, published in journals in the field of gastroenterology and hepatology (GH). Methods: Quality of reporting and methodological quality were evaluated by assessing the adherence of papers to PRISMA checklist and AMSTAR quality scale. After identifying the GH journals which endorsed PRISMA in instructions for authors (IA), we appraised: 15 papers published in 2012 explicitly mentioning PRISMA in the full text (Group A); 15 papers from the same journals published in 2012 not explicitly mentioning PRISMA in the full text (Group B); 30 papers published the year preceding PRISMA endorsement from the same journals as above (Group C); 30 papers published in 2012 on the 10 highest impact factor journals in GH which not endorsed PRISMA (Group D). Results: PRISMA statement was referred in the IA in 9 out of 70 GH journals (12.9%). We found significant increase in overall adherence to PRISMA checklist (Group A, 90.1%; Group C, 83.1%; p = 0.003) and compliance to AMSTAR scale (Group A, 85.0%; Group C, 74.6%; p = 0.002), following the PRISMA endorsement from the nine GH journals. Explicit referencing of PRISMA in manuscript was not associated with increase in quality of reporting and methodological quality (Group A vs. B, p = 0.651, p = 0.900, respectively). Adherence to PRISMA checklist, and the compliance with AMSTAR were significantly higher in journals endorsing PRISMA compared to those not (Groups A+B vs. D; p = 0.003 and p = 0.016, respectively). Conclusion: The endorsement of PRISMA resulted in increase of both quality of reporting and methodological quality. It is advised that an increasing number of medical journals include PRISMA in the instructions for authors.","[Panic, Nikola; Leoncini, Emanuele; de Belvis, Giulio; Ricciardi, Walter; Boccia, Stefania] Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Inst Publ Hlth, Sect Hyg, Rome, Italy; [Panic, Nikola] Univ Belgrade, Fac Med, Belgrade, Serbia; [Panic, Nikola] Univ Clin Hosp Ctr Dr Dragisa Misovic Dedinje, Belgrade, Serbia; [Boccia, Stefania] IRCCS San Raffaele Pisana, Rome, Italy",Catholic University of the Sacred Heart; IRCCS Policlinico Gemelli; University of Belgrade; IRCCS San Raffaele Pisana,"Boccia, S (corresponding author), Univ Cattolica Sacro Cuore, Inst Publ Hlth, Sect Hyg, Rome, Italy.",sboccia@rm.unicatt.it,"Ricciardi, Walter/AAB-2056-2019; Boccia, Stefania/AFN-1666-2022; , emanuele/A-5466-2010","Boccia, Stefania/0000-0002-1864-749X; , emanuele/0000-0002-7669-8535; Ricciardi, Walter/0000-0002-5655-688X; deBelvis, Antonio G./0000-0003-2446-9930",ERAWEB project; European Community; Fondazione Veronesi,ERAWEB project; European Community; Fondazione Veronesi(Fondazione Umberto Veronesi),"The work of Nikola Panic was supported by the ERAWEB project, funded with support of the European Community.

MethodologyFifty animal studies related to endodontics were randomly selected from the PubMed database with publication dates from January 2017 to December 2021. For each study, a score of '1' was given when the item of the PRIASE 2021 checklist was fully reported, whereas a score of '0' was given when an item was not reported; when the item was inadequately or partially reported, a score of '0.5' was given. Based on the overall scores allocated to each manuscript, they were allocated into three categories of reporting quality: low, moderate and high. Associations between study characteristics and reporting quality scores were also analysed. Descriptive statistics and Fisher's exact tests were used to describe the data and determine associations. The probability value of .05 was selected as the level of statistical significance. ResultsBased on the overall scores, four (8%) and 46 (92%) of the animal studies evaluated were categorized as 'High' and 'Moderate' reporting quality, respectively. A number of items were adequately reported in all studies related to background (Item 4a), relevance of methods/results (7a) and interpretation of images (11e), whereas only one item related to changes in protocol (6d) was not reported in any. No associations were confirmed between reporting quality scores and number of authors, origin of the corresponding author, journal of publication (endodontic specialty vs. non- specialty), impact factor or year of publication. ConclusionsAnimal studies published in the specialty of endodontics were mostly of 'moderate' quality in terms of the quality of reporting.

Methodology Fifty randomized clinical trials relating to Endodontics were randomly selected from the PubMed database from 2015 to 2019 and evaluated by two independent reviewers. For each trial, a score of '1' was awarded when it fully reported each item in the PRIRATE guidelines whereas a score of '0' was awarded when an item was not reported; when the item was reported inadequately a score of '0.5' was awarded. For the items that were not relevant to the trial, 'Not Applicable (NA)' was given. Based on the interquartile range of the overall scores received, trials were categorized into 'Low' (0-58.4%), 'Moderate' (58.5-72.8%) and 'High' (72.9-100%) quality. The associations between characteristics and quality of clinical trials were investigated. Descriptive statistics, frequency analysis and percentage analyses were used to describe the data. To determine the significance of categorical data, the chi-square test was used. The probability value 0.05 was considered as the level of significance. Results Based on the overall scores, 13 (26%), 25(50%) and 12 (24%) of the reports of clinical trials were categorized as 'High', 'Moderate' and 'Low' quality, respectively. Three items (1b, 6d, 11e) were adequately reported in all manuscripts whilst two items (5k, 5m) were scored 'NA' in all the reports. The reports published from Europe had a significantly greater percentage of 'High'-quality scores, compared to Asia, Middle East, North America and South America (P = 0.0002). The 'High'-quality reports were published significantly more often in impact factor journals (P = 0.045). Reports of clinical trials published in journals that adhered to the CONSORT guidelines had significantly more 'High' scores compared to those that did not (P = 0.008). Clinical trials with protocols registered a priori had a significantly greater percentage of 'High' scores compared to the trials that were not registered in advance (P = 0.003). No significant difference occurred between the quality of clinical trials and the number of authors, journal (Endodontic specialty vs. Non-Endodontic specialty) or year of publication. Conclusions Reports of randomized clinical trials published in the speciality of Endodontics had a substantial number of deficiencies. To create high-quality reports of clinical trials, authors should comply with the PRIRATE 2020 guidelines.","[Nagendrababu, V.] Univ Sharjah, Dept Prevent & Restorat Dent, Coll Dent Med, POB 27272, Sharjah, U Arab Emirates; [Jakovljevic, A.] Univ Belgrade, Sch Dent Med, Dept Pathophysiol, Belgrade, Serbia; [Jacimovic, J.] Univ Belgrade, Sch Dent Med, Cent Lib, Belgrade, Serbia; [Duncan, H.

Randomized controlled and clinical controlled trials, in which experimental groups received fixed orthodontic therapy and malodor was measured, were included. Patients treated with fixed orthodontic brackets were compared with those without any treatment, and SLB systems were compared with CB systems. Two reviewers independently selected potentially relevant studies, evaluated the risk for bias, extracted essential data, and synthesized findings using Review Manager version 5.3 (Copenhagen: The. Nordic Cochrane Centre, The Cochrane Collaboration, 2014).Results:Four studies, involving a total of 152 participants, met the inclusion criteria. Fixed orthodontic appliances caused malodor from the initial visit to 2 to 3 months, but was only significant after the first week (mean difference 20.24 [95% confidence interval [CI]11.75-28.74]; P<.00001). Plaque index, gingival index, and periodontal pocket depths demonstrated no statistical differences between the SLB and CB groups after the first week. However, SLBs significantly controlled malodor better than CBs after the first week (mean difference 4.32 [95% CI 6.02 to 2.61]; P<.00001). The quality of the included studies was relatively low and relevant research in this field is quite scarce.Conclusions:Although the evidence base was relatively weak, fixed orthodontic treatment appeared to be a risk factor for malodor, independent of periodontal changes, and SLB systems controlled malodor better than CB systems.","[Huang, Jing; Jiang, Jiu-Hui] Peking Univ, Sch & Hosp Stomatol, Dept Orthodont, 22 South Zhongguancun Ave, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China; [Huang, Jing; Jiang, Jiu-Hui] Peking Univ, Sch & Hosp Stomatol, Cent Lab, Beijing, Peoples R China",Peking University; Peking University,"Jiang, JH (corresponding author), Peking Univ, Sch & Hosp Stomatol, Dept Orthodont, 22 South Zhongguancun Ave, Beijing 100081, Peoples R China.",drjiangw@163.com,"Huang, Jing/HNO-8615-2023",,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [81171006, 81571002]; Beijing Natural Science Foundation [7162203]; Beijing Science and Technology Committee [Z121107001012024]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Beijing Natural Science Foundation(Beijing Natural Science Foundation); Beijing Science and Technology Committee,"This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 81171006, 81571002), Beijing Natural Science Foundation (No. 7162203), and also by the Beijing Science and Technology Committee.

The aim of this study was to use the PRICE 2020 guidelines to appraise a sample of 50 case reports related to dental traumatology that were published before the guidelines were available in order to assess various parameters influencing the reporting quality. MethodsFifty case reports published between 2015 and 2019 and related to dental traumatology were randomly selected from the PubMed database. Reports were assessed by two independent evaluators using the PRICE checklist. Each item received a score of 1 if the manuscript met all pertinent criteria, 0 if it was not reported, and 0.5 if it was reported insufficiently. Not Applicable (NA) was assigned to items that were irrelevant to a specific report. The estimated total PRICE score for each case report was computed by adding all the scores, with a maximum score of 47 minus any NA scores. Descriptive and Inferential statistics (Student's t-test and ANOVA) were used for analysis. ResultsThe percentage of case reports that fully met each applicable criteria ranged from 0% to 100%. The percentage of case reports partially satisfying each applicable criterion varied from 0% to 88%. There was a significant difference in scores for case reports published in journals with an impact factor compared with those without (p = .042). No significant difference was observed between the mean scores that compared the period of publication. There was no significant difference between journals that followed the CARE guidelines and those that did not. ConclusionSeveral items within the PRICE 2020 guidelines were either not reported or only partially reported in case reports related to dental traumatology prior to the checklist publication. It is recommended that authors follow the PRICE 2020 guidelines to improve the overall quality of their case reports.","[Nagendrababu, Venkateshbabu; Gopinath, Vellore Kannan] Univ Sharjah, Coll Dent Med, Dept Prevent & Restorat Dent, Sharjah, U Arab Emirates; [Sarao, Simran Kaur] Ohio State Univ, Coll Dent, Columbus, OH USA; [Berlin-Broner, Yuli; Levin, Liran] Univ Alberta, Fac Med & Dent, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Shetty, Naresh Yedthare] Ajman Univ, Coll Dent, Dept Clin Sci, Ajman, U Arab Emirates; [Shetty, Naresh Yedthare] Ctr Med & Biomed Allied Hlth Sci Res, Deanship Grad Studies & Res, Ajman, U Arab Emirates; [Duncan, Henry F.] Dublin Dent Univ Hosp, Trinity Coll Dublin, Div Restorat Dent, Dublin, Ireland; [Abbott, Paul V.] Univ Western Australia, UWA Dent Sch, Perth, WA, Australia; [Dummer, Paul M.

Overview of reviews of observational studies (ie, umbrella reviews) synthesise systematic reviews with or without meta-analyses of cross-sectional, case-control and cohort studies, and may also aid in the grading of the credibility of reported associations. The number of published umbrella reviews has been increasing. Recently, a reporting guideline for overviews of reviews of healthcare interventions (Preferred Reporting Items for Overviews of Reviews (PRIOR)) was published, but the field lacks reporting guidelines for umbrella reviews of observational studies. Our aim is to develop a reporting guideline for umbrella reviews on cross-sectional, case-control and cohort studies assessing epidemiological associations. Methods and analysis We will adhere to established guidance and prepare a PRIOR extension for systematic reviews of cross-sectional, case-control and cohort studies testing epidemiological associations between an exposure and an outcome, namely Preferred Reporting Items for Umbrella Reviews of Cross-sectional, Case-control and Cohort studies (PRIUR-CCC). Step 1 will be the project launch to identify stakeholders. Step 2 will be a literature review of available guidance to conduct umbrella reviews. Step 3 will be an online Delphi study sampling 100 participants among authors and editors of umbrella reviews. Step 4 will encompass the finalisation of PRIUR-CCC statement, including a checklist, a flow diagram, explanation and elaboration document. Deliverables will be (i) identifying stakeholders to involve according to relevant expertise and end-user groups, with an equity, diversity and inclusion lens; (ii) completing a narrative review of methodological guidance on how to conduct umbrella reviews, a narrative review of methodology and reporting in published umbrella reviews and preparing an initial PRIUR-CCC checklist for Delphi study round 1; (iii) preparing a PRIUR-CCC checklist with guidance after Delphi study; (iv) publishing and disseminating PRIUR-CCC statement. Ethics and dissemination PRIUR-CCC has been approved by The Ottawa Health Science Network Research Ethics Board and has obtained consent (20220639-01H). Participants to step 3 will give informed consent. PRIUR-CCC steps will be published in a peer-reviewed journal and will guide reporting of umbrella reviews on epidemiological associations.","[Solmi, Marco] Univ Ottawa, Psychiat, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Solmi, Marco] Charite, Dept Child & Adolescent Psychiat, Berlin, Germany; [Solmi, Marco] Ottawa Hosp, Dept Mental Hlth, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Solmi, Marco] Univ Ottawa, Ottawa Hosp Res Inst OHRI, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Cobey, Kelly] Univ Ottawa, Open Sci & Meta Res Program, Heart Inst, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Moher, David] Ottawa Hosp, Ottawa Methods Ctr, Res Inst, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Ebrahimzadeh, Sanam] Ottawa Hosp, Res Inst, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Dragioti, Elena] Linkoping Univ, Pain & Rehabil Ctr, Linkoping, Sweden; [Dragioti, Elena] Linkopings Univ, Dept Med & Hlth Sci, Linkoping, Sweden; [Dragioti, Elena] Univ Ioannina, Sch Hlth Sci, Dept Nursing, Res Lab Psychol Patients Families & Hlth Profess, Ioannina, Greece; [Shin, Jae Il] Yonsei Univ, Coll Med, Seoul, South Korea; [Radua, Joaquim] Inst Invest Biomed August Pi i Sunyer, Barcelona, Spain; [Radua, Joaquim] Univ Barcelona, Inst Invest Biomed August Pi i Sunyer, CIBERSAM, Barcelona, Spain; [Cortese, Samuele] Univ Southampton, Fac Environm & Life Sci, Ctr Innovat Mental Hlth, Sch Psychol, Southampton, England; [Cortese, Samuele] Univ Southampton, Fac Med, Clin & Expt Sci CNS & Psychiat, Southampton, England; [Cortese, Samuele] Solent NHS Trust, Southampton, England; [Cortese, Samuele] NYU, NYU Langone, Hassenfeld Childrens Hosp, Child Study Ctr, New York, NY USA; [Cortese, Samuele] Univ Bari Aldo Moro, DiMePRe J Dept Precis & Rigenerat Med Jonic Area, Bari, Italy; [Shea, Beverley] Ottawa Hlth Res Inst, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Veronese, Nicola] Univ Palermo, Palermo, Italy; [Hartling, Lisa] Univ Alberta, Pediat, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Pollock, Michelle] Inst Hlth Econ, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Egger, Matthias] Univ Bern, Inst Social & Prevent Med, Bern, Switzerland; [Egger, Matthias] Univ Bristol, Bristol Med Sch, Populat Hlth Sci, Bristol, England; [Papatheodorou, Stefania] Rutgers Sch Publ Hlth, Dept Epidemiol, Piscataway, NJ USA; [Papatheodorou, Stefania] Harvard TH Chan Sch Publ Hlth, Boston, MA USA; [Ioannidis, John P.] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA USA; [Carvalho, Andre F.] Deakin Univ, IMPACT Innovat Mental & Phys Hlth & Clin Treatment, Sch Med, Barwon Hlth, Geelong, Vic, Australia",University of Ottawa; Berlin Institute of Health; Free University of Berlin; Humboldt University of Berlin; Charite Universitatsmedizin Berlin; University of Ottawa; Ottawa Hospital Research Institute; University of Ottawa; University of Ottawa; University of Ottawa Heart Institute; University of Ottawa; Ottawa Hospital Research Institute; University of Ottawa; Ottawa Hospital Research Institute; Linkoping University; Linkoping University; University of Ioannina; Yonsei University; Yonsei University Health System; University of Barcelona; Hospital Clinic de Barcelona; IDIBAPS; CIBER - Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red; CIBERSAM; University of Barcelona; Hospital Clinic de Barcelona; IDIBAPS; University of Southampton; University of Southampton; NYU Langone Medical Center; New York University; Universita degli Studi di Bari Aldo Moro; University of Ottawa; Ottawa Hospital Research Institute; University of Palermo; University of Alberta; University of Bern; University of Bristol; Rutgers University System; Harvard University; Harvard T.H.

PRISMA-NMA includes 32 items: 27 core items as indicated in the 2009 PRISMA Statement and five items specific to the reporting of NMAs. Although NMA reporting is improving, it is unclear whether PRISMA-NMA has accelerated this improvement. We aimed to investigate the impact of PRISMA-NMA and highlight key items that require attention and improvement. Methods: We updated our previous collection of NMAs with articles published between April 2015 and July 2018. We assessed the completeness of reporting for each NMA, including main manuscript and online supplements, using the PRISMA-NMA checklist. The PRISMA-NMA checklist originally includes 32 total items (i.e. a 32-point scale original PRISMA-NMA score). We also prepared a modified version of the PRISMA-NMA checklist with 49 items to evaluate separately at a more granular level all multiple-content items (i.e. a 49-point scale modified PRISMA-NMA score). We compared average reporting scores of articles published until and after 2015. Results: In the 1144 included NMAs the mean modified PRISMA-NMA score was 32.1 (95% CI 31.8-32.4) of a possible 49-excellence-score. For 1-year increase, the mean modified score increased by 0.96 (95% CI 0.32 to 1.59) for 389 NMAs published until 2015 and by 0.53 (95% CI 0.02 to 1.04) for 755 NMAs published after 2015. The mean modified PRISMA-NMA score for NMAs published after 2015 was higher by 0.81 (95% CI 0.23 to 1.39) compared to before 2015 when adjusting for journal impact factor, type of review, funding, and treatment category. Description of summary effect sizes to be used, presentation of individual study data, sources of funding for the systematic review, and role of funders dropped in frequency after 2015 by 6-16%. Conclusions: NMAs published after 2015 more frequently reported the five items associated with NMA compared to those published until 2015. However, improvement in reporting after 2015 is compatible with that observed on a yearly basis until 2015, and hence, it could not be attributed solely to the publication of the PRISMA-NMA.","[Veroniki, Areti Angeliki; Tsokani, Sofia; Zevgiti, Stella; Kontouli, Katerina-Maria; Mavridis, Dimitris] Univ Ioannina, Sch Educ, Dept Primary Educ, Ioannina, Greece; [Veroniki, Areti Angeliki; Straus, Sharon E.; Tricco, Andrea C.] St Michaels Hosp, Li Ka Shing Knowledge Inst, Knowledge Translat Program, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Pagkalidou, Irene] Aristotle Univ Thessaloniki, Med Sch, Dept Hyg Social Prevent Med & Med Stat, Thessaloniki, Greece; [Ambarcioglu, Pinar] Mustafa Kemal Univ, Fac Vet Med, Dept Biostat, Tayfur Sokmen Kampusu, TR-31060 Antakya, Hatay, Turkey; [Pandis, Nikos] Univ Bern, Med Fac, Dept Orthodont & Dentofacial Orthoped, Dent Sch, Bern, Switzerland; [Lunny, Carole] Univ British Columbia, Cochrane Hypertens Review Grp & Therapeut Initiat, Vancouver, BC, Canada; [Nikolakopoulou, Adriani] Univ Freiburg, Fac Med & Med Ctr, Inst Med Biometry & Stat, Freiburg, Germany; [Nikolakopoulou, Adriani; Papakonstantinou, Theodoros; Salanti, Georgia] Univ Bern, Inst Social & Prevent Med, Bern, Switzerland; [Chaimani, Anna] Univ Paris, Res Ctr Epidemiol & Stat, INRA, INSERM,Sorbonne Paris Cite,CRES,UMR1153, Paris, France; [Chaimani, Anna] Cochrane France, Paris, France; [Straus, Sharon E.] Univ Toronto, Dept Geriatr Med, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Hutton, Brian] Ottawa Hosp Res Inst, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Hutton, Brian] Univ Ottawa, Sch Epidemiol & Publ Hlth, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Tricco, Andrea C.] Univ Toronto, Dalla Lana Sch Publ Hlth, Epidemiol Div, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Mavridis, Dimitris] Paris Descartes Univ, Sorbonne Paris Cite, Fac Med, Paris, France",University of Ioannina; University of Toronto; Li Ka Shing Knowledge Institute; Saint Michaels Hospital Toronto; Aristotle University of Thessaloniki; Mustafa Kemal University; University of Bern; University of British Columbia; University of Freiburg; University of Bern; Universite Paris Cite; Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Medicale (Inserm); INRAE; University of Toronto; University of Ottawa; Ottawa Hospital Research Institute; University of Ottawa; University of Toronto; Universite Paris Cite,"Veroniki, AA (corresponding author), Univ Ioannina, Sch Educ, Dept Primary Educ, Ioannina, Greece.",averoniki@uoi.gr,"Mavridis, Dimitris/H-5452-2019; Tricco, Andrea/B-9920-2011; Kontouli, Katerina Maria/AFL-9942-2022; Tsokani, Sofia/ACU-0230-2022; Salanti, Georgia/AFL-0550-2022; Chaimani, Anna/AAA-3048-2020","Tsokani, Sofia/0000-0002-6258-8861; Kontouli, Katerina Maria/0000-0003-4261-2841; Mavridis, Dimitris/0000-0003-1041-4592; Salanti, Georgia/0000-0002-3830-8508",Swiss National Science Foundation [179158]; European Union [754936]; SNSF [320030_179158]; Tier 1 Canada Research Chair in Knowledge Translation; Tier 2 Canada Research Chair in Knowledge Synthesis; Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF) [320030_179158] Funding Source: Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF),Swiss National Science Foundation(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); European Union(European Union (EU)); SNSF(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)); Tier 1 Canada Research Chair in Knowledge Translation; Tier 2 Canada Research Chair in Knowledge Synthesis; Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)(Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)),"This work was supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation grant/award number 179158.

Systematic reviews (SRs) on moxibustion are increasing. Although the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement provides guidelines for SRs, the quality of moxibustion-related SRs is still not satisfactory. In particular, descriptions of the interventions and the rationale for using moxibustion are insufficient. To address these inadequacies, the working group developed this PRISMA extension for reporting SRs of moxibustion (PRISMA-M 2020). Methods: A group of CM clinical professionals, methodologists of SRs, reporting guideline developers, and journal editors developed this PRISMA-M 2020 through a comprehensive process that includes registration, literature review, consensus meetings, Delphi exercises for soliciting comments, and revision, resulting in this final draft. Results: Seven of the 27 PRISMA checklist items, namely title (1), rationale (3), eligibility criteria (6), data item (11), additional analyses (16), study characteristics (18), and additional analysis (23), were extended, with specific reference to the application of moxibustion. Illustrative examples and explanations for each item are provided. Conclusion: The PRISMA-M 2020 will help improve the reporting quality of SRs with moxibustion.

Oversimplification and inconsistencies in reporting about complex interventions can limit the usability of review findings. Rationale: Although guidance exists to ensure that reports of individual studies and systematic reviews adhere to accepted scientific standards, their design-specific focus leaves important reporting gaps relative to complex interventions in health care. This paper provides a stand-alone extension to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) reporting tool for complex interventions-PRISMA-CI-to help authors, publishers, and readers understand and apply to systematic reviews of complex interventions. Discussion: PRISMA-CI development followed the Enhancing the QUAlity and Transparency Of health Research Network guidance for extensions and focused on adding or modifying only essential items that are truly unique to complex interventions and are not covered by broader interpretation of current PRISMA guidance. PRISMA-CI provides an important structure and guidance for systematic reviews and meta-analyses for the highly prevalent and dynamic field of complex interventions. (C) 2017 The Authors.

While several clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) related to ankle injuries have been developed by various organizations, there is a lack of critical appraisal of them. The purpose of this systematic review is to identify and critically appraise evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (EB-CPGs) related to acute ankle injuries in adults.MethodWe conducted searches in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE databases, WHO, and reviewed 98 worldwide orthopedic association websites up until early 2023. Two authors independently applied the inclusion and exclusion criteria, and each evidence-based clinical practice guideline (EB-CPG) underwent independent critical appraisal of its content by all four authors using the Appraisal of Guidelines for REsearch and Evaluation (AGREE II) instrument. AGREE II scores for each domain were then calculated.ResultsThis review included five evidence-based clinical practice guidelines. The mean scores for all six domains were as follows: Scope and Purpose (87.8%), Stakeholder Involvement (69.2%), Rigour of Development (72.5%), Clarity of Presentation (86.9%), Applicability (45.6%), and Editorial Independence (53.3%).ConclusionThe number of EB-CPGs related to ankle injuries are limited and the overall quality of the existing evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (EB-CPGs) for ankle injuries is not strong, with three of them being outdated. However, valuable guidance related to Ottawa rules, manual therapy, cryotherapy, functional supports, early ambulation, and rehabilitation has been highlighted. Challenges remain in areas such as monitoring and/or auditing criteria, consideration of the target population's views and preferences, and ensuring editorial independence. Future guidelines should prioritize improvements in these domains to enhance the quality and relevance of ankle injury management.Systematic reviewSystematic review.","[Bsoul, Najeeb; Ning, Liang; Mazmanyan, Davit; Porter, Daniel] Tsinghua Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Bsoul, Najeeb; Ning, Liang; Mazmanyan, Davit; Porter, Daniel] Tsinghua Univ, Affiliated Hosp 1, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Cai, Leyi] Wenzhou Med Univ, Affiliated Hosp 2, Wenzhou, Peoples R China",Tsinghua University; Tsinghua University; Wenzhou Medical University,"Ning, L (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China.;Ning, L (corresponding author), Tsinghua Univ, Affiliated Hosp 1, Beijing, Peoples R China.",liangning1984@hotmail.com,"bsoul, najeeb/KHW-8383-2024; Longting, Lin/IXD-9042-2023","Bsoul, Najeeb/0000-0002-0424-3195",,,,,71,0,0,4,4,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,1471-2474,,BMC MUSCULOSKEL DIS,BMC Musculoskelet.

This is why the Mediterranean diet is now called a sustainable diet. This study focuses on legumes, protein-rich foods of vegetable origin, cultivated in the area, as their production and use in cooking are highly sustainable. The analysis covers their consumption over the last 10 years in the entire Mediterranean area, looking specifically at Spain. The objectives of this work are to analyze the production of legumes in the Mediterranean area, taking into account the fact that they are an important environmental as well as food resource, and to analyze how the consumption of legumes has changed in certain countries bordering the Mediterranean in relation to social and cultural changes, with particular attention to the pandemic. The study shows how, in Spain, since 2020, the consumption of legumes has increased, demonstrating that in emergency situations, different dietary choices are made. In addition, it shows how legumes are an excellent source of vegetable protein and an important environmental resource from the perspective of sustainability.","[Carlini, Betty] Italian Govt, Minist Educ & Merit, Viale Trastevere 76-A, I-00153 Rome, Italy; [Carlini, Betty; Lucini, Cristina; Velazquez, Javier] Catholic Univ Avila, Fac Sci & Arts, Dept Environm & Agroforestry, Avila 05005, Spain",Santa Teresa Jesus Catholic University of Avila,"Velázquez, J (corresponding author), Catholic Univ Avila, Fac Sci & Arts, Dept Environm & Agroforestry, Avila 05005, Spain.",betty.carlini@einstein-nebbia.edu.it; cristina.lucini@ucavila.es; javier.velazquez@ucavila.es,"Lucini, Cristina/KIB-7833-2024; Velazquez, Javier/I-8762-2019","Velazquez, Javier/0000-0002-9188-3827; LUCINI, CRISTINA/0000-0002-2818-3123",,,,,107,1,1,1,5,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2071-1050,,SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL,Sustainability,APR,2024,16,7,,,,,,,3081,10.3390/su16073081,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su16073081,,,15,Green & Sustainable Science & Technology; Environmental Sciences; Environmental Studies,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),Science & Technology - Other Topics; Environmental Sciences & Ecology,NN8K6,,gold,,,2024-11-25,WOS:001201219200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Pedagogical practices in physical education are specifically addressed, as well as other scenarios where strategies for teaching this subject were applied. The review is based on the consultation of the Web of Science and Scopus-Elsevier databases, covering the last five years (2019-2023) in South America. From this review, articles were selected that detail training experiences aimed at stimulating pedagogical practices in various educational environments and levels. Systematic reviews were identified focusing on specific aspects such as training in values, reflective practices in evaluation and other contributions related to physical education. In terms of methodology, qualitative approaches prevailed, with the interview being the main instrument for collecting information. On the other hand, in quantitative methodologies, questionnaires (especially the Likert scale in the evaluation of competencies and selfefficacy) were the most used. The results obtained position Chile as a leader in research on this topic in the region. In conclusion, a trend is observed that indicates that the emphasis on the qualification of the teacher's pedagogical practices in physical education focuses mainly on their professional performance. This approach is justified by considering that it is from this point that the necessary competencies are developed to address current demands in the specific contexts of Latin America","[Poblete-Valderrama, Felipe; Sagredo, Angelica Vera] Univ Catolica Santisima Concepcion Chile, Concepcion, Chile; [Cabarcas, Yeiro David Barros; Norena, Jhon Orrego] Univ Caldas, Manizales, Chile; [Pavez-Adasme, Gustavo] Univ Adventista Chile, Nuble, Chile; [Rodriguez, Alejandro Martin] Univ Oriente, Santiago De Cuba, Cuba; [Alvear-Mora, Carolina] Col Sagrados Corazones Chile, Santiago, Chile; [Kuerten, Viviana Rodas] Universidad Santo Tomas Chile, Bio Bio, Chile",Universidad Catolica de la Santisima Concepcion; Universidad de Oriente Santiago de Cuba,"Poblete-Valderrama, F (corresponding author), Univ Catolica Santisima Concepcion Chile, Concepcion, Chile.",felipepobletev@gmail.com; ydbarros@hotmail.com; jhon.rios_m@ucaldas.edu.co; avera@ucsc.cl; gustavopavez@unach.cl; alejandromartinrodriguez92@gmail.com; calvearmora@concepcionsscc.cl; clararodasku@santotomas.cl,,,,,,,36,0,0,0,0,FEDERACION ESPANOLA ASOC DOCENTES EDUCACION FISICA-FEADEF,MURCIA,"C CABO VIDIO 27, SAN JAVIER, MURCIA, 30730, SPAIN",1579-1726,1988-2041,,RETOS-NUEV TEND EDUC,Retos,,2024,,59,,,,,944,952,,,,,,9,"Hospitality, Leisure, Sport & Tourism",Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Social Sciences - Other Topics,G4V0E,,,,,2024-11-25,WOS:001316620500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

After decades, several procedures in orthopaedic foot surgery have been suggested for reducing the risk of wound and neurovascular complications. The goal of this Prisma statement guidelines compliant systematic review was to establish the effectiveness and safety of calcaneal osteotomy in foot surgery. We have performed a novel systematic review of the current published literature in order to evaluate the scientific evidence now available on this association, assigning predefined exclusion and inclusion criteria. Eight investigations were selected which had 191 cases. The adult flatfoot, tibialis posterior reconstruction and cavovarus foot deformity were treated with different procedures of calcaneal osteotomy techniques. The adequate level of effectiveness of calcaneal osteotomy is associated with the kind and location of the incision, with or without screw application, in each specific foot condition. There is a limited number of scientific investigations of the effectiveness and safety of the different kinds of calcaneal osteotomy in foot surgery, and there is the need to enhance outcome knowledge on this foot surgery technique.","[Lopez-Lopez, Daniel] Univ A Coruna, Fac Nursing & Podiatry, Dept Hlth Sci, Res Hlth & Podiatry Grp, Ferrol, Spain; [Larrainzar-Garijo, Ricardo] Univ Complutense, Med Sch, Orthopaed & Trauma Dept, Hosp Univ Infanta Leonor, Madrid, Spain; [Becerro-de-Bengoa-Vallejo, Ricardo] Univ Complutense Madrid, Fac Nursing Physiotherapy & Podiatry, Madrid, Spain; [Losa-Iglesias, Marta Elena] Univ Rey Juan Carlos, Fac Hlth Sci, Alcorcon, Spain; [Bayod-Lopez, Javier] Univ Zaragoza, Biomed Res Networking Ctr Bioengn Biomat & Nanome, Aragon Inst Engn Res I3A, Grp Appl Mech & Bioengn AMB, Zaragoza, Spain",Universidade da Coruna; Complutense University of Madrid; Hospital Universitario Infanta Leonor; Complutense University of Madrid; Universidad Rey Juan Carlos; University of Zaragoza; CIBER - Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red; CIBERBBN,"López-López, D (corresponding author), Univ A Coruna, Dept Ciencias Saude, Grp Invest Saude & Podol, Campus Univ Esteiro S-N, Ferrol 15403, Spain.",daniellopez@udc.es,"Larrainzar-Garijo, Ricardo/AAE-3594-2019; Becerro de Bengoa Vallejo, Ricardo/P-4153-2019; Losa Iglesias, Marta Elena/B-8830-2009; Lopez Lopez, Prof. Dr. Daniel/K-9182-2013; Becerro de Bengoa Vallejo, Ricardo/B-8857-2009","/0000-0001-5505-6974; Losa Iglesias, Marta Elena/0000-0001-7588-2069; Larrainzar-Garijo, Ricardo/0000-0002-0501-2006; Lopez Lopez, Prof. Dr. Daniel/0000-0002-9818-6290; Becerro de Bengoa Vallejo, Ricardo/0000-0003-1568-7602",Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation [PID2019-108009RB-I00],"Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation(Ministry of Science and Innovation, Spain (MICINN)Spanish Government)",This research was funded by Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation through the project PID2019-108009RB-I00.,,22,2,3,1,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1742-4801,1742-481X,,INT WOUND J,Int.

The 27-item checklist and four-phase flow diagram have become the hallmark of academic rigour in the publication of systematic reviews and meta-analyses, having been cited by over 60,000 papers [3]. These are frequently endorsed by journals in their 'Instructions to Authors' [4]. Developments in the methodology and terminology used when conducting systematic reviews [5], alongside the identification of limitations responsible for poor adherence, such as the use of ambiguous wording [6], have warranted an update to the PRISMA statement. The PRISMA 2020 statement, therefore, is intended to reflect this recent evolution in the identification, selection, appraisal and synthesis of research [7]. Here, we present an interpretive analysis of the updated statement, with a view towards encouraging its adoption by both journals and authors in the pursuit of advancing evidence-based medicine.","[Sohrabi, Catrin] Queen Mary Univ London, Barts & London Sch Med & Dent, London, England; [Franchi, Thomas] Univ Sheffield, Med Sch, Sheffield, S Yorkshire, England; [Mathew, Ginimol] York Teaching Hosp NHS Fdn Trust, York, N Yorkshire, England; [Kerwan, Ahmed] East & North Hertfordshire NHS Trust, Stevenage, Herts, England; [Nicola, Maria] Imperial Coll Healthcare NHS Trust, London, England; [Griffin, Michelle] Stanford Univ, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Agha, Maliha; Agha, Riaz] IJS Publishing Grp, London, England; [Agha, Riaz] Harley Clin Grp, 10 Harley St, London, England",University of London; Queen Mary University London; University of Sheffield; Imperial College London; Stanford University,"Agha, R (corresponding author), IJS Publishing Grp, London, England.;Agha, R (corresponding author), Harley Clin Grp, 10 Harley St, London, England.",mail@riazagha.com,"Agha, Riaz/KLC-2726-2024; Sohrabi, Catrin/AAQ-6271-2020; Franchi, Thomas/AAT-1843-2020",,,,,,40,71,72,1,12,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",1743-9191,1743-9159,,INT J SURG,Int.

Yet, the literature searching component of systematic reviews and related review types is often poorly reported. Guidance for literature search reporting has been diverse and, in many cases, does not offer enough detail to authors who need more specific information about reporting search methods and information sources in a clear, reproducible way. This document presents the PRISMA-S (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses literature search extension) checklist, and explanation and elaboration. Methods: The checklist was developed using a three-stage Delphi survey process, followed by a consensus conference and public review process. Results: The final checklist includes sixteen reporting items, each of which is detailed with exemplar reporting and rationale. Conclusions: The intent of PRISMA-S is to complement the PRISMA Statement and its extensions by providing a checklist that could be used by interdisciplinary authors, editors, and peer reviewers to verify that each component of a search is completely reported and, therefore, reproducible.","[Rethlefsen, Melissa L.] Univ New Mexico, Hlth Sci Lib, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA; [Rethlefsen, Melissa L.] Univ New Mexico, Informat Ctr, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA; [Rethlefsen, Melissa L.] Univ Utah, Spencer S Eccles Hlth Sci Lib, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA; [Rethlefsen, Melissa L.] Univ Florida, Hlth Sci Ctr Lib, George Smathers Lib, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; [Kirtley, Shona] Univ Oxford, Botnar Res Ctr, UK EQUATOR Ctr, Ctr Stat Med CSM,Nuffield Dept Orthopaed Rheumato, Oxford, England; [Waffenschmidt, Siw] Inst Qual & Efficiency Hlth Care, Informat Management Unit, Cologne, Germany; [Ayala, Ana Patricia] Univ Toronto, Gerstein Sci Informat Ctr, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Moher, David] Ottawa Hosp, Res Inst, Ctr Journalol, Clin Epidemiol Program, Gen Campus,Ctr Practice Changing Res Bldg, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Page, Matthew J.] Monash Univ, Sch Publ Hlth & Prevent Med, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Koffel, Jonathan B.] Univ Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN USA",University of New Mexico; University of New Mexico; Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah; State University System of Florida; University of Florida; University of Oxford; University of Toronto; University of Ottawa; Ottawa Hospital Research Institute; Monash University; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Rethlefsen, ML (corresponding author), Univ New Mexico, Hlth Sci Lib, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA.;Rethlefsen, ML (corresponding author), Univ New Mexico, Informat Ctr, Albuquerque, NM 87131 USA.",mlrethlefsen@gmail.com; shona.kirtley@csm.ox.ac.uk; siw.waffenschmidt@iqwig.de; anap.ayala@utoronto.ca; dmoher@ohri.ca; matthew.page@monash.edu; jbkoffel@umn.edu,"Moher, David/I-3408-2019; Ayala, Ana Patricia/P-8955-2015; Rethlefsen, Melissa/B-6840-2009; Pannabecker, Virginia/P-1321-2018","Couban, Rachel/0000-0001-8672-2845; Ayala, Ana Patricia/0000-0002-3613-2270; Kirtley, Shona/0000-0002-7801-5777; Stevens, Adrienne/0000-0002-6257-4806; Weinfurter, Elizabeth/0000-0003-3541-7861; Page, Matthew/0000-0002-4242-7526; Farrah, Kelly/0000-0002-4211-0705; Waffenschmidt, Siw/0000-0001-6860-6699; Ross-White, Amanda/0000-0003-4737-0968; Shields, Tracy/0000-0001-5670-7388; Rethlefsen, Melissa/0000-0001-5322-9368; Pannabecker, Virginia/0000-0001-8661-2320; Chang, Steven/0000-0002-3193-7969","University of Utah's Center for Clinical and Translational Science under the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences of the National Institutes of Health [UL1TR002538]; Cancer Research UK [C49297/A27294]; Australian Research Council Discovery Early Career Researcher Award [DE200101618]; University Research Chair, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Canada; Systematic Reviews Special Interest Group (SIG) of the Medical Library Association","University of Utah's Center for Clinical and Translational Science under the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences of the National Institutes of Health; Cancer Research UK(Cancer Research UK); Australian Research Council Discovery Early Career Researcher Award(Australian Research Council); University Research Chair, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Canada; Systematic Reviews Special Interest Group (SIG) of the Medical Library Association","Melissa L.

The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement was developed to facilitate transparent and complete reporting of systematic reviews and has been updated (to PRISMA 2020) to reflect recent advances in systematic review methodology and terminology. Here, we present the explanation and elaboration paper for PRISMA 2020, where we explain why reporting of each item is recommended, present bullet points that detail the reporting recommendations, and present examples from published reviews. We hope that changes to the content and structure of PRISMA 2020 will facilitate uptake of the guideline and lead to more transparent, complete, and accurate reporting of systematic reviews.","[Page, Matthew J.;

Yet, the literature searching component of systematic reviews and related review types is often poorly reported. Guidance for literature search reporting has been diverse, and, in many cases, does not offer enough detail to authors who need more specific information about reporting search methods and information sources in a clear, reproducible way. This document presents the PRISMA-S (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses literature search extension) checklist, and explanation and elaboration. Methods The checklist was developed using a 3-stage Delphi survey process, followed by a consensus conference and public review process. Results The final checklist includes 16 reporting items, each of which is detailed with exemplar reporting and rationale. Conclusions The intent of PRISMA-S is to complement the PRISMA Statement and its extensions by providing a checklist that could be used by interdisciplinary authors, editors, and peer reviewers to verify that each component of a search is completely reported and therefore reproducible.","[Rethlefsen, Melissa L.] Univ Florida, George A Smathers Lib, Hlth Sci Ctr Lib, Gainesville, FL 33430 USA; [Kirtley, Shona] Univ Oxford, UK EQUATOR Ctr, Ctr Stat Med CSM,Botnar Res Ctr, Nuffield Dept Orthopaed Rheumatol & Musculoskelet, Windmill Rd, Oxford OX3 7LD, England; [Waffenschmidt, Siw] Inst Qual & Efficiency Hlth Care, Cologne, Germany; [Ayala, Ana Patricia] Univ Toronto, Gerstein Sci Informat Ctr, Toronto, ON, Canada; [Moher, David] Ottawa Hosp, Ottawa Hosp Res Inst, Ctr Journalol, Clin Epidemiol Program, Gen Campus,Ctr Practice Changing Res Bldg, Ottawa, ON K1H 8L6, Canada; [Page, Matthew J.] Monash Univ, Sch Publ Hlth & Prevent Med, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Koffel, Jonathan B.] Univ Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida; University of Oxford; University of Toronto; University of Ottawa; Ottawa Hospital Research Institute; Monash University; University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Rethlefsen, ML (corresponding author), Univ Florida, George A Smathers Lib, Hlth Sci Ctr Lib, Gainesville, FL 33430 USA.",mlrethlefsen@gmail.com,"Moher, David/I-3408-2019; Ayala, Ana Patricia/P-8955-2015; Rethlefsen, Melissa/B-6840-2009","Moher, David/0000-0003-2434-4206; Kirtley, Shona/0000-0002-7801-5777; Conway, Aislinn/0000-0002-7566-3138; Ross-White, Amanda/0000-0003-4737-0968; Waffenschmidt, Siw/0000-0001-6860-6699; Ayala, Ana Patricia/0000-0002-3613-2270; Farrah, Kelly/0000-0002-4211-0705; Rethlefsen, Melissa/0000-0001-5322-9368; Shields, Tracy/0000-0001-5670-7388; Stevens, Adrienne/0000-0002-6257-4806; Page, Matthew/0000-0002-4242-7526; Chang, Steven/0000-0002-3193-7969; Couban, Rachel/0000-0001-8672-2845","University of Utah's Center for Clinical and Translational Science under the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences of the National Institutes of Health [UL1TR002538]; Cancer Research UK [C49297/A27294]; Australian Research Council [DE200101618]; University Research Chair, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Canada; Systematic Reviews SIG of the Medical Library Association; MRC [MR/J00488X/1] Funding Source: UKRI; Australian Research Council [DE200101618] Funding Source: Australian Research Council","University of Utah's Center for Clinical and Translational Science under the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences of the National Institutes of Health; Cancer Research UK(Cancer Research UK); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council); University Research Chair, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Canada; Systematic Reviews SIG of the Medical Library Association; MRC(UK Research & Innovation (UKRI)Medical Research Council UK (MRC)); Australian Research Council(Australian Research Council)","Melissa Rethlefsen was funded in part by the University of Utah's Center for Clinical and Translational Science under the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences of the National Institutes of Health Award Number UL1TR002538 in 2017-2018.

Objective: To assess the compliance of systematic reviews and meta -analyses in leading dermatology journals with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta -analyses (PRISMA) statement guidelines. Methods: This review was carried out in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Included studies were reviews published across 6 years in the top 4 highest-impact-factor dermatology journals of 2017. Records and full texts were screened independently. Data analysis was conducted with univariate multivariable linear regression. The primary outcome was to assess the compliance of systematic reviews and metaanalyses in leading dermatology journals with the PRISMA statement. Results: A total of 166 studies were included and mean PRISMA compliance across all articles was 73%. Compliance significantly improved over time ( b = .016; P = \ .001). The worst reported checklist item was item 5 (reporting on protocol existence), with a compliance of 15% of articles. Conclusion: PRISMA compliance within leading dermatology journals could be improved; however, it is steadily improving.

Reporting quality of reviews is of critical importance in order to judge the quality and risk of bias in a review to ensure sound healthcare decisions are made. This is particularly important in the field of dermatology due to the growing number of systematic reviews and their key role in informing healthcare decision within dermatology. A contemporary and comprehensive review of the compliance of dermatology systematic reviews and meta-analyses with the PRISMA checklist, in the highest impact factor dermatology journals, has not yet been assessed. To our knowledge, our review represents the most extensive study assessing reporting quality of systematic reviews and meta-analyses published within dermatology to date. Methods and analysis: Our protocol is reported in line with the Preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta-analysis protocols (PRISMA-P) 2015 guidelines. MEDLINE will be searched to look for systematic reviews and meta-analysis in selected years within the top four highest impact factor dermatology journals in 2017. Records and full texts will be screened independently by five researchers. Data will be extracted onto a standard data extraction database. A training session will take place to ensure accurate data extraction and scoring of studies with the PRISMA checklist. The data will be analysed and outcomes will be determined. Primary outcome will be the compliance of reviews with the PRISMA checklist. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of Surgical Associates Ltd.

They have increasingly become the subject of systematic reviews and are challenging to effectively report. The Complex Interventions Methods Workgroup developed an extension to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses for Complex Interventions (PRISMA-CI). Rationale: Following the EQUATOR Network guidance for Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis extensions, this Explanation and Elaboration (EE) document accompanies the PRISMA-CI checklist to promote consistency in reporting of systematic reviews of complex interventions. Discussions: The EE document explains the meaning and rationale for each unique PRISMA-CI checklist item and provides examples to assist systematic review authors in operationalizing PRISMA-CI guidance. The Complex Interventions Workgroup developed PRISMA-CI as an important start toward increased consistency in reporting of systematic reviews of complex interventions. Because the field is rapidly expanding, the Complex Interventions Methods Workgroup plans to re-evaluate periodically for the need to add increasing specificity and examples as the field matures.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the quality of meta-analyses and systematic reviews according to the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines in the anesthesia literature. Methods: A search was conducted to identify all meta-analyses ever been published in the British Journal of Anaesthesia (BJA), Anaesthesia, and Korean Journal of Anesthesiology (KJA) between Jan. 01, 2004 and Nov. 31, 2016. We aimed to apply the AMSTAR and PRISMA checklists to all published meta-analyses. Results: We identified 121 meta-analyses in the anesthesia literature from January 2004 through the end of November 2016 (BJA; 75, Anaesthesia; 43, KJA; 3). The number of studies published and percentage of 'Yes' responses for meta-analysis articles published after the year 2010 was significantly increased compared to that of studies published before the year 2009 (P = 0.014 for Anaesthesia). In the anesthesia literature as a whole, participation of statisticians as authors statistically improved average scores of PRISMA items (P = 0.004) especially in the BJA (P = 0.003). Conclusions: Even though there is little variability in the reporting and methodology of meta-analysis in the anesthesia literature, significant quality improvement in the reporting was observed in the Anaesthesia by applying the PRISMA checklist. Participation of a statistician as an author improved the reporting quality of the meta-analysis.","[Oh, Jae Hoon; Shin, Woo Jong; Park, Suin; Chung, Jae Soon] Hanyang Univ, Dept Anesthesiol & Pain Med, Coll Med, Seoul, South Korea",Hanyang University,"Shin, WJ (corresponding author), Hanyang Univ, Dept Anesthesiol & Pain Med, Guri Hosp, 153 Gyeongchun Ro, Guri 11923, South Korea.",swj0208@hanyang.ac.kr,"Shin, Woo Jong/M-8518-2017","Shin, Woo Jong/0000-0002-3786-2267",,,,,23,7,7,0,3,KOREAN SOC ANESTHESIOLOGISTS,SEOUL,"101-3503, LOTTE CASTLE PRESIDENT, 109 MAPO-DAERO, MAPO-GU, SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA",2005-6419,2005-7563,,KOREAN J ANESTHESIOL,Korean J.

This may allow researchers and clinicians to be equipped to appraise existing literatures based on known deficit to look for or expect. The objective of this study was to assess the compliance of systematic reviews and meta-analysis in the management of brain AVM. Methods: Systematic reviews and meta-analyses articles published in medical journals between 1st of May 2011 and 30th April 2016 (five-year period) were examined. Exclusion criteria were articles that were not systematic reviews and not meta-analyses, narrative literature reviews, historical literature reviews, animal studies, unpublished articles, commentaries and letter to the editor. Electronic database search performed through Medline PubMed on 20th September 2016. Results: This systematic review examined seven systematic review articles on intracranial arteriovenous malformation compliance with PRISMA statement guidelines. The mean percentage of applicable PRISMA items across all studies was 74% (range 67-93%). Protocol registration and declaration, risk of bias and funding sources were the most poorly reported of the PRISMA items (14% each). A significant variance in the total percentages was evident between studies (67-93%). Conclusion: Systematic review reporting in medical literature is excessively variable and overall poor. As these papers are being published with increasing frequency, need to fully adhere to PRISMA statement guide for systematic review to ensure high-quality publications. Complete reporting of PRISMA items within systematic reviews in cerebral arteriovenous malformation enhance quality assessment, robust critical appraisal, better judgement and ultimately sound application to practice thereby improving research standards and patients care.

Objective: To assess the compliance of systematic reviews published in craniofacial journals with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) reporting criteria. Data sources, search terms and study selection: Thomson Reuters impact factor was used to identify three top craniofacial journals. A search for all systematic review articles published in these journals from 1st May 2010 to 30th April 2015 was conducted using MEDLINE PubMed. Data extraction: Two independent researchers assessed each study for inclusion and performed the data extraction. Data included the article reference information; the pathology and interventions examined and compliance of each review article with the PRISMA checklist. Data synthesis and results: 97 studies were returned by the search. 62 studies proceeded to data extraction. The mean percentage of applicable PRISMA items that were met across all studies was 72.5% (range 28.6-96.2%). The area of poorest compliance was with the declaration of a study protocol (19.4% of studies). Only 37.1% of studies declared their source of funding.

Available guidelines, including PRISMA-P (2015) and PRISMA (2009), do not cover all the complexities associated with reporting systematic reviews in the paediatric population. Using a collaborative, multidisciplinary structure, we aim to develop evidence-based and consensus-based PRISMA-P-C (Protocol for Children) and PRISMA-C (Children) Extensions to guide paediatric systematic review protocol and completed review reporting. Methods and analysis: This project's methodology follows published recommendations for developing reporting guidelines and involves the following six phases; (1) establishment of a steering committee representing key stakeholder groups; (2) a scoping review to identify potential Extension items; (3) three types of consensus activities including meetings of the steering committee to achieve high-level decisions on the content and methodology of the Extensions, a survey of key stakeholders to generate a list of possible items to include in the Extensions and a formal consensus meeting to select the reporting items to add to, or modify for, the Extension; (4) the preliminary checklist items generated in phase III will be evaluated against the existing evidence and reporting practices in paediatric systematic reviews; (5) extension statements and explanation and elaboration documents will provide detailed advice for each item and examples of good reporting; (6) development and implementation of effective knowledge translation of the extension checklist, and an evaluation of the Extensions by key stakeholders. Ethics and Dissemination: This protocol was considered a quality improvement project by the Hospital for Sick Children's Ethics Committee and did not require ethical review. The resultant checklists, jointly developed with all relevant stakeholders, will be disseminated through peer-reviewed journals as well as national and international conference presentations. Endorsement of the checklist will be sought simultaneously in multiple journals.","[Kapadia, Mufiza Z.; Bhutta, Zulfiqar A.; Offringa, Martin] Univ Toronto, Hosp Sick Children, Res Inst, Dept Child Hlth Evaluat Sci, Toronto, ON M5G 1X8, Canada; [Askie, Lisa] Univ Sydney, NHMRC Clin Trials Ctr, Systemat Reviews & Hlth Technol Assessment, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia; [Hartling, Lisa] Univ Alberta, Dept Pediat, Alberta Res Ctr Hlth Evidence, Edmonton, AB, Canada; [Contopoulos-Ioannidis, Despina] Stanford Univ, Dept Pediat, Div Infect Dis, Sch Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Contopoulos-Ioannidis, Despina] Meta Res Innovat Ctr Stanford METRICS, Stanford, CA USA; [Soll, Roger] Univ Vermont, Coll Med, Dept Pediat, Burlington, VT USA; [Soll, Roger] Vermont Oxford Network, Burlington, VT USA; [Moher, David] Ottawa Hosp Res Inst, Ctr Practice Changing Res, Ottawa, ON, Canada",University of Toronto; Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids); University of Sydney; University of Alberta; Stanford University; University of Vermont; University of Ottawa; Ottawa Hospital Research Institute,"Kapadia, MZ (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Hosp Sick Children, Res Inst, Dept Child Hlth Evaluat Sci, Toronto, ON M5G 1X8, Canada.",Mufiza.farid@gmail.com,"Bhutta, Zulfiqar/ADZ-0156-2022; Moher, David/I-3408-2019; Bhutta, Zulfiqar/L-7822-2015","Bhutta, Zulfiqar/0000-0003-0637-599X; Offringa, Martin/0000-0002-4402-5299; Wasif, Muhammad/0009-0004-1374-302X; Moher, David/0000-0003-2434-4206",Hospital for Sick Children Investigator award; Canadian Institutes of Health Research; CIHR [345296],Hospital for Sick Children Investigator award; Canadian Institutes of Health Research(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)); CIHR(Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)),MO is supported by the Hospital for Sick Children Investigator award.

The guideline development process should be precise and rigorous to ensure that the results are reproducible and not vague. To determine the quality of guidelines, the Appraisal of Guidelines and Research and Evaluation (AGREE) instrument was developed and introduced. The objective of this study is to assess the methodological quality of CPGs on pancreatic cancer. Five databases (included MEDLINE and EMBASE) and guideline websites were searched till April, 2014. The methodological quality of the guidelines was assessed by 4 authors independently using the AGREE II instrument. From 2526 citations, 21 relevant guidelines were included. The overall agreement among reviewers was moderate (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.86, 95% confidence interval 0.64-0.96). The mean scores were moderate for the domains scope and purpose'' and clarity of presentation''; however, they were low for the domains stakeholder involvement'' (31.22), rigor of development'', applicability'', and editorial independence''. These domain scores were lower when compared with international levels. There are 5 (23.81%) guidelines that described the systematic methods for searching. Moreover, only 5 (23.81%) guidelines reported that methodological expertise were included in the guideline developing teams. The quality and transparency of the development process and the consistency in the reporting of pancreatic cancer guidelines need to be improved. Many other methodological disadvantages were identified. In the future, pancreatic cancer CPGs should base on the best available evidence rigorously developed and reported. Greater efforts are needed to provide high-quality guidelines that serve as a useful and reliable tool for clinical decision making in this field.","[He, Zhiyun; Jin, Lan; Zhou, Xiaona; Liu, Xiaoye; Guo, Wei; Zhang, Zhongtao] Beijing Friendship Hosp, Dept Gen Surg, 95 Yongan Rd, Beijing 100050, Peoples R China; [He, Zhiyun; Song, Ailin] Lanzhou Univ, Hosp 2, Dept Gen Surg, Lanzhou 730000, Gansu, Peoples R China; [Tian, Hongliang] Nanjing Univ, Sch Med, Jinling Hosp, Res Inst Gen Surg, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Capital Medical University; Lanzhou University; Nanjing University,"Zhang, ZT (corresponding author), Beijing Friendship Hosp, Dept Gen Surg, 95 Yongan Rd, Beijing 100050, Peoples R China.",zhangzht@medmail.com.cn,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China [81172318],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),This project is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 81172318).,,39,8,8,0,14,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",0025-7974,1536-5964,,MEDICINE,Medicine (Baltimore),MAR,2015,94,12,,,,,,,e635,10.1097/MD.0000000000000635,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/MD.0000000000000635,,,9,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),General & Internal Medicine,CE5LE,25816030,"Green Published, gold",,,2024-11-25,WOS:000351875600005,View Full Record in Web of Science

One step in reaching this goal is to improve the rigorous, scientific evidence base on the impacts of policies on inequities in health outcomes, resource allocation, and use. Systematic reviews are increasingly recognized as a valuable source of evidence for both health care and health systems decision making, yet very few systematic reviews report effects on health equity. We developed consensus-based reporting guidelines for equity-focused systematic reviews in order to help reviewers identify, extract, and synthesise evidence on equity in systematic reviews. Increased use of these reporting guidelines will help improve the reporting of effects on both inequities in health outcomes and health care use across gender, socioeconomic position, and other characteristics, both in systematic reviews and eventually primary research, thus contributing to the global agenda to improve health equity.","[Welch, Vivian; Tugwell, Peter; O'Neill, Jennifer] Univ Ottawa, Inst Populat Hlth, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Petticrew, Mark] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, London WC1, England; [Moher, David] Ottawa Hosp Res Inst, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Waters, Elizabeth] Univ Melbourne, McCaughey Ctr, Melbourne Sch Populat Hlth, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [White, Howard] Int Initiat Impact Evaluat 3ie, Washington, DC USA",University of Ottawa; University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine; University of Ottawa; Ottawa Hospital Research Institute; University of Melbourne,"Welch, V (corresponding author), Univ Ottawa, Inst Populat Hlth, Ottawa, ON, Canada.",vivian.welch@uottawa.ca,"Welch, Vivian/AAD-9338-2020; Petticrew, Mark/AAY-6274-2021; Moher, David/I-3408-2019; Tugwell, Peter/AFD-8076-2022","White, Howard/0000-0002-6298-0310; Moher, David/0000-0003-2434-4206; Welch, Vivian/0000-0002-5238-7097; Tugwell, Peter/0000-0001-5062-0556",,,,,35,18,21,1,8,PAN AMER HEALTH ORGANIZATION,WASHINGTON,"525 23RD ST NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20037 USA",1020-4989,1680-5348,,REV PANAM SALUD PUBL,Rev.

Additionally, researchers have been increasingly utilizing optimization models in sustainable supply chain management. This article presents a review of sustainable supply chain management literature and explores the utilization of optimization models in this domain. This review article critically examines sustainable supply chain management challenges and the application of optimization models to address them. This literature review uses PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-analyses) methodology. By exploring the Web of Science and Scopus databases, 86 publications published during 2014-2023 in 44 journals have been identified for conducting this review. A complete assessment of these studies concludes that the research that integrates the three dimensions of sustainability, viz. economic, environmental, and social, is limited. Future research should focus on developing a comprehensive framework that captures the three dimensions of sustainability simultaneously. This can be achieved by developing optimization models that concurrently consider economic, environmental, and social issues. In addition, future research should focus more on developing and applying stochastic models capturing uncertainties in the supply chain to design a practical and sustainable supply chain network.","[Kumar, Kaushal; Kumar, Amit] Univ Delhi, Fac Math Sci, Dept Operat Res, New Delhi, Delhi, India",University of Delhi,"Kumar, K (corresponding author), Univ Delhi, Fac Math Sci, Dept Operat Res, New Delhi, Delhi, India.",kkumar@or.du.ac.in; akumar1@or.du.ac.in,,,,,,,106,0,0,2,2,SPRINGERNATURE,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON, N1 9XW, ENGLAND",2509-4238,2509-4246,,PROC INTEGR OPTIM,Process Integr.

We investigated the quality of reporting for meta-analyses of acupuncture published in PubMed. We compared the compliance rate for the quality of reporting following the publication of both the PRISMA and PRISMA-A recommendations. We searched PubMed for articles published between January 1st, 2020 and December 31st, 2022, after Endnote X9 document management software and manual screening, 180 meta-analyses of acupuncture were selected as samples. The PRISMA, and PRISMA-A checklists were used to evaluate the quality of the literature. Data were collected using a standard form. Pearson chi(2) test and/or Fisher exact test were used to assess differences in reporting among groups. Logistic regression is used to calculate OR and its 95% CI. The total reported compliance rate of all items in the PRISMA list was 61.3%, and the reported compliance rate of the items with a compliance rate of <50% accounted for 35.71% of the total items. The total reported coincidence rate of all items in the PRISMA-A was 56.9%, and the reported coincidence rate of the items with a reported coincidence rate of <50% accounted for 31.25% of all the items. The compliance rate of the published research to PRISMA or PRISMA-A has no statistical difference between the Journal Citation Reports partition (Quarter1-Quarter2) and Journal Citation Reports partition (Quarter3-Qurater4) (P > .05). Regardless of the level of journals published, have obvious deficiencies in the details of the study, the reference basis for the design of the study, the analysis method, the degree of strictness, the scientific nature, and other aspects.

This article describes the development of an extension of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 guideline: PRISMA-COSMIN for OMIs 2024. Methods: The development process followed the Enhancing the QUAlity and Transparency Of health Research (EQUATOR) guidelines and included a literature search, expert consultations, a Delphi study, a hybrid workgroup meeting, pilot testing, and an end-of- project meeting, with integrated patient/public involvement. Results: From the literature and expert consultation, 49 potentially relevant reporting items were identified. Round 1 of the Delphi study was completed by 103 panelists, whereas round 2 and 3 were completed by 78 panelists. After 3 rounds, agreement (>= 67%) >= 67%) on inclusion and wording was reached for 44 items. Eleven items without consensus for inclusion and/or wording were discussed at a workgroup meeting at- tended by 24 participants. Agreement was reached for the inclusion and wording of 10 items, and the deletion of 1 item. Pilot testing with 65 authors of OMI systematic reviews further improved the guideline through minor changes in wording and structure, finalized during the end-of- project meeting. The final checklist to facilitate the reporting of full systematic review reports contains 54 (sub)items addressing the review's title, abstract, plain language summary, open science, introduction, methods, results, and discussion. Thirteen items pertaining to the title and abstract are also included in a separate abstract checklist, guiding authors in reporting for example conference abstracts. Conclusion: PRISMA-COSMIN for OMIs 2024 consists of two checklists (full reports; abstracts), their corresponding explanation and elaboration documents detailing the rationale and examples for each item, and a data flow diagram. PRISMA-COSMIN for OMIs 2024 can improve the reporting of systematic reviews of OMIs, fostering their reproducibility and allowing end-users to appraise the quality of OMIs and select the most appropriate OMI for a specific application.","[Elsman, Ellen B.

MethodThe difference in risk of immune-associated pneumonitis between PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors was assessed by two different meta-analysis methods, the Mirror-pairing and the PRISMA guidelines. ResultsA total of eighty-eight reports were used for meta-analysis, while thirty-two studies were used for the Mirror-pairing. Both PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors (used alone or combined with chemotherapy) increased the risk of developing immune-related pneumonitis (P < 0.00001; P < 0.00001). Based on indirect analyses results (subgroup analyses), the risk of PD-L1-induced pneumonitis was weaker than that of PD-1 inhibitors when the control group was chemotherapy (OR = 3.33 vs. 5.43) or placebo (OR = 2.53 vs. 3.19), while no obvious significant differences were found (P = 0.17; P = 0.53). For the Mirror-pairing-based meta-analysis, the risk of PD-1-induced pneumonitis was significantly higher than that of PD-L1 inhibitors (OR = 1.46, 95%CI [1.08, 1.98], I2 = 0%, Z = 2.47 (P = 0.01)). However, this difference was not significant, when they were combined with chemotherapy (OR = 1.05, 95%CI [0.68, 1.60], I2 = 38%, Z = 0.21 (P = 0.84)). ConclusionBoth PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors increased the risk of immune-related pneumonitis, while the risk of PD-1-induced pneumonitis was significantly higher than that of PD-L1 inhibitors.","[Tian, Yuan; Dang, Qi] Shandong First Med Univ, Shandong Canc Hosp & Inst, PhaseClin Res Ctr 1, 440,Jiyan Rd, Jinan 250117, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Tian, Yuan; Dang, Qi] Shandong Acad Med Sci, 440,Jiyan Rd, Jinan 250117, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Tian, Yuan; Li, Zhuoqi] Shandong Univ, Shandong Prov Gen Hosp 2, Radiotherapy Dept, Jinan 250299, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Yin, Zongxiu] Shandong First Med Univ, Jinan Cent Hosp, Dept Pulm & Crit Care Med, Jinan 250013, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Chi] Shandong Univ, Hosp 2, Cheeloo Coll Med, Dept Cardiol, Jinan 250033, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yuanyuan] Shandong Univ Tradit Chinese Med, Affiliated Hosp 2, Dept Oncol, Jinan 250299, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Kai] Wen Shang Cty Peoples Hosp, Gen Surg Dept, Jining 272500, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Chen, Feng] Shandong First Med Univ, Shandong Canc Hosp & Inst, Dept Thorac Surg, Jinan 250117, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Chen, Feng] Shandong Acad Med Sci, Jinan 250117, Shandong, Peoples R China",Shandong First Medical University & Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences; University of Jinan; Shandong First Medical University & Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences; Shandong University; Shandong First Medical University & Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences; Shandong University; Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine; Shandong First Medical University & Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences; University of Jinan; Shandong First Medical University & Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences,"Dang, Q (corresponding author), Shandong First Med Univ, Shandong Canc Hosp & Inst, PhaseClin Res Ctr 1, 440,Jiyan Rd, Jinan 250117, Shandong, Peoples R China.;Dang, Q (corresponding author), Shandong Acad Med Sci, 440,Jiyan Rd, Jinan 250117, Shandong, Peoples R China.",tytytianyuan@aliyun.com; yinzx123@163.com; 202135774@mail.sdu.edu.cn; wyyjswyy@yeah.net; zhangkai7271833@163.com; chenfeng19830923@sina.com; dangqi123456@126.com,"LI, ZHUOQI/HPH-4971-2023",,Clinical Research Special Support Fund of Wu Jieping Medical Foundation [320.6570.2023-16-12]; Shandong Medical Association Clinical Special Fund-Qilu Special Fund [YXH2022ZX02016]; Shandong Second People's Hospital Research Fund [2023MS01],Clinical Research Special Support Fund of Wu Jieping Medical Foundation; Shandong Medical Association Clinical Special Fund-Qilu Special Fund; Shandong Second People's Hospital Research Fund,"This study was funded by the Clinical Research Special Support Fund of Wu Jieping Medical Foundation (320.6570.2023-16-12; Yuan Tian), Shandong Medical Association Clinical Special Fund-Qilu Special Fund (YXH2022ZX02016; Yuan Tian), and Shandong Second People's Hospital Research Fund (2023MS01; Yuan Tian).",,97,0,0,3,3,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",0340-7004,1432-0851,,CANCER IMMUNOL IMMUN,Cancer Immunol.

Episodes of jaundice occurring in GS negatively affect patients' quality of life. This systematic review aimed to analyze clinical studies regarding nutrition in people with GS. The study followed the PRISMA guidelines and utilized the Ebsco, Embase, Cochrane, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases to search clinical trials focused on diet/nutrition in GS (1963-2023 years). The methodological quality of selected studies was assessed using the Jadad scale. As a result, 19 studies met the inclusion criteria. The research mainly focused on the impact of caloric restriction, consumption of various diet variants, and vegetables and fruits on hyperbilirubinemia and metabolic health. A nutritional intervention consisting of not applying excessive calorie restrictions and consuming fats and biologically active compounds in vegetables and fruits (Cruciferae, Apiaceous, Rutaceae) may prevent the occurrence of jaundice episodes. It is justified to conduct further research on detecting such compounds in food, which, by influencing the expression of the UGT liver enzyme gene, could contribute to regulating bilirubin concentration in the blood of people with GS.","[Goluch, Zuzanna] Wroclaw Univ Econ & Business, Dept Food Technol & Nutr, Komandorska 118 120, PL-53345 Wroclaw, Poland; [Wierzbicka-Rucinska, Aldona] Childrens Mem Hlth Inst, Dept Clin Biochem Radioimmunol & Expt Med, PL-04730 Warsaw, Poland; [Ksiazek, Ewelina] Wroclaw Univ Econ & Business, Dept Agr Engn & Qual Anal, Komandorska 118 120, PL-53345 Wroclaw, Poland",Wroclaw University of Economics & Business; Children's Memorial Health Institute; Wroclaw University of Economics & Business,"Goluch, Z (corresponding author), Wroclaw Univ Econ & Business, Dept Food Technol & Nutr, Komandorska 118 120, PL-53345 Wroclaw, Poland.;Wierzbicka-Rucinska, A (corresponding author), Childrens Mem Hlth Inst, Dept Clin Biochem Radioimmunol & Expt Med, PL-04730 Warsaw, Poland.",zuzanna.goluch@ue.wroc.pl; a.wierzbicka-rucinska@ipczd.pl; ewelina.ksiazek@ue.wroc.pl,"Ksiazek, Ewelina/S-4562-2018; Goluch, Zuzanna/H-2845-2013","Ksiazek, Ewelina/0000-0001-6416-0458; Goluch, Zuzanna/0000-0002-6241-3914; Wierzbicka-Rucinska, Aldona/0000-0002-9578-8894",Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,"This research received no external funding, and the APC was funded by the Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute.",,65,0,0,1,1,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2072-6643,,NUTRIENTS,Nutrients,JUL,2024,16,14,,,,,,,2247,10.3390/nu16142247,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/nu16142247,,,31,Nutrition & Dietetics,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Nutrition & Dietetics,ZS6W3,39064690,"Green Published, gold",,,2024-11-25,WOS:001277330300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Systematic review publications have increased from a sporadic few in 1980s to more than 10,000 systematic reviews published every year and around 30,000 registered in prospective registries. MethodsA cross-sectional design and a variety of data sources were triangulated to identify the journals from which systematic reviews would be evaluated for adherence to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 reporting guidelines and scope. Specifically, this study used the PRISMA 2020 reporting guidelines to assess the reporting of the introduction, methods, information sources and search strategy, study selection process, quality/bias assessments, and results and discussion aspects of the included systematic reviews. ResultsUpon review of the 215 systematic reviews published in 10 top-tier journals in the field of nursing in 2019 and 2020, this study identified several opportunities to improve the reporting of systematic reviews in the context of the 2020 PRISMA statement. Areas of priority for reporting include the following key areas: (1) information sources, (2) search strategies, (3) study selection process, (4) bias reporting, (5) explicit discussion of the implications to policy, and lastly, the need for (6) prospective protocol registration. DiscussionThe use of the PRISMA 2020 guidelines by authors, peer reviewers, and editors can help to ensure the transparent and detailed reporting of systematic reviews published in the nursing literature. Clinical RelevanceSystematic reviews are considered strong research evidence that can guide evidence-based practice and even clinical decision-making. This paper addresses some common methodological and process issues among systematic reviews that can guide clinicians and practitioners to be more critical in appraising research evidence that can shape nursing practice.","[Torres, Gian; Bongar, Maria Victoria; Loa, Ritzmond; Montana, Sherihan] Univ Santo Tomas, Coll Nursing, Manila, Philippines; [Ledbetter, Leia; Cantrell, Sarah; Hendren, Steph] Duke Univ, Sch Med, Med Ctr Lib & Arch, Durham, NC USA; [Alomo, Anna Rita L.] Univ Santo Tomas, Miguel De Benavides Lib, Manila, Philippines; [Blodgett, Thomas J.; Turner, Kathleen M.; Relf, Michael V.] Duke Univ, Sch Nursing, Durham, NC USA; [Hatoum, Sandy; Relf, Michael V.] Duke Univ, Duke Global Hlth Inst, Durham, NC USA; [Sumile, Earl] Univ Philippines Manila, Coll Nursing, Manila, Philippines; [Torres, Gian] Univ Santo Tomas, Coll Nursing, 3-F St Martin De Porres Bldg,Espana Blvd, Sampaloc 1015, Manila, Philippines; [Relf, Michael V.] Duke Univ, Sch Nursing, DUMC 3322, 307 Trent Dr, Durham, NC 27710 USA",University of Santo Tomas; Duke University; University of Santo Tomas; Duke University; Duke University; University of the Philippines System; University of the Philippines Manila; University of Santo Tomas; Duke University,"Torres, G (corresponding author), Univ Santo Tomas, Coll Nursing, 3-F St Martin De Porres Bldg,Espana Blvd, Sampaloc 1015, Manila, Philippines.;Relf, MV (corresponding author), Duke Univ, Sch Nursing, DUMC 3322, 307 Trent Dr, Durham, NC 27710 USA.",gstorres@ust.edu.ph; michael.relf@duke.edu,"Loa, Ritzmond/GOK-1413-2022; Cantrell, Sarah/T-5729-2019; Ledbetter, Leila/N-9513-2014","LOA, RITZMOND/0000-0002-3599-7926; Alomo, Anna Rita/0009-0002-2513-8690; Ledbetter, Leila/0000-0002-5206-8002; Relf, Michael/0000-0002-4951-8869; Cantrell, Sarah/0000-0003-2694-7836",,,,,29,0,0,3,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",1527-6546,1547-5069,,J NURS SCHOLARSHIP,J.

However, its impact on the masticatory musculature and the stomatognathic system is an area of growing interest, as it involves the adjustment of occlusion and tooth movement. This systematic review aims to comprehensively assess and synthesise existing evidence regarding the influence of clear aligner therapy on the masticatory musculature and the stomatognathic system.MethodsAn exhaustive search was performed on electronic databases that adhered to PRISMA guidelines. Clinical studies that evaluated the impact of patients receiving aligner orthodontic treatment on the muscles of the mastication and stomatognathic systems were included. A standardised data extraction form was devised for relevant variables. Two reviewers extracted the data variables. ROB-2 was used for bias evaluation in the selected studies.ResultsA total of six studies met the inclusion criteria. The wearing of clear aligners significantly impacted the muscles of mastication. Muscle activity and discomfort showed a significant alteration in the initial days of appliance placement. but this observation was temporary, with no significant changes thereafter in subsequent follow-up. Bite force reduction was also noted. All the studies evaluated showed good methodological quality.ConclusionThe review found that aligned orthodontic treatment may have a variable impact on muscles of mastication, with a potential for initial exacerbation of symptoms followed by possible improvement. However, due to the limited number of studies and their heterogeneous nature, further robust research is recommended to fully understand the relationship between aligned orthodontic treatment and masticatory muscles.","[Almalki, Sultan Abdulrahman] Prince Sattam Bin AbdulAziz Univ, Coll Dent, Dept Prevent Dent Sci, Al Kharj 99142, Norway; [Al Jameel, AlBandary Hassan] King Saud Univ, Coll Dent, Dept Periodont & Community Dent, POB 11645, Riyadh 11545, Saudi Arabia; [Gowdar, Inderjit Murugendrappa] Prince Sattam Bin AbdulAziz Univ, Coll Dent, Dept Prevent Dent Sci, Abha 11942, Saudi Arabia; [Langaliya, Akshayraj] AMC Dent Coll & Hosp, Dept Conservat Dent & Endodont, Ahmadabad, Gujarat, India; [Vaddamanu, Sunil Kumar] King Khalid Univ, Dept Dent Technol Coll Appl Med Siecence, Dept Prosthodont, Abha, Abha, Saudi Arabia; [Di Blasio, Marco] Univ Parma, Dept Med & Surg, Dent Ctr, I-43126 Parma, Italy; [Cervino, Gabriele] Univ Messina, Sch Dent, Dept Biomed & Dent Sci & Morphofunct Imaging, Via Consolare Valeria 1, I-98125 Messina, Italy; [Minervini, Giuseppe] Saveetha Univ, Saveetha Dent Coll & Hosp, Saveetha Inst Med & Tech Sci SIMATS, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India; [Minervini, Giuseppe] Univ Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Dept Med Surg & Odontostomatol Specialties, Naples, Italy",King Saud University; Prince Sattam Bin Abdulaziz University; King Khalid University; University of Parma; University of Messina; Saveetha Institute of Medical & Technical Science; Saveetha Dental College & Hospital; Universita della Campania Vanvitelli,"Vaddamanu, SK (corresponding author), King Khalid Univ, Dept Dent Technol Coll Appl Med Siecence, Dept Prosthodont, Abha, Abha, Saudi Arabia.;Di Blasio, M (corresponding author), Univ Parma, Dept Med & Surg, Dent Ctr, I-43126 Parma, Italy.",snu@kku.edu.sa; marco.diblasio@studenti.unipr.it,"Di Blasio, Marco/IRY-9855-2023; minervini, giuseppe/AAM-9828-2021; vaddamanu, sunil/AAX-1781-2020; Cervino, Gabriele/K-9418-2019; AlJameel, AlBandary/KIA-7707-2024; gowdar, inderjit/ABH-9639-2020","vaddamanu, sunil/0000-0002-1583-3246; Di Blasio, Marco/0000-0003-2629-9381; gowdar, inderjit/0000-0002-3920-8082",Deanship of Scientific Research at King Khalid University [RGP1/347/44],Deanship of Scientific Research at King Khalid University(King Khalid UniversityKing Saud University),The authors extend their appreciation to the Deanship of Scientific Research at King Khalid University for funding this work through small group Research Project under grant number RGP1/347/44.,,65,0,0,2,2,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1472-6831,,,BMC ORAL HEALTH,BMC Oral Health,MAR 19,2024,24,1,,,,,,,350,10.1186/s12903-024-04029-8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12903-024-04029-8,,,11,"Dentistry, Oral Surgery & Medicine",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),"Dentistry, Oral Surgery & Medicine",LO5X8,38504207,"Green Published, gold",,,2024-11-25,WOS:001187769100003,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study sought to assess the recent evidence of clinicians' knowledge, beliefs, and practice regarding opportunistic prostate cancer screening comparing urologists and generals practitioners. Methods: A systematic search was conducted in 3 online databases: MEDLINE, Web of Science and EMBASE (from January 1, 2015, to January 9th, 2023). Studies that explored clinicians' knowledge, beliefs, and practices regarding opportunistic prostate cancer screening were included. Studies were assessed for quality reporting according to the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational studies in Epidemiology guidelines. Results: A total of 14 studies met the inclusion criteria: ten studies included primary care health professionals, three studies included urologists, and one study included both. Studies involving general practitioners showed a generally low level of awareness of the recommended uses of the test, and urologists showed a greater knowledge of clinical practice guidelines. General practitioners' opinion of prostate-specific antigen was generally unfavourable in contrast to urologists' who were more likely to be proactive in ordering the test. Less than half of the included studies evaluated shared-decision making in practice and 50% of clinicians surveyed implemented it. Conclusion: General practitioners had less knowledge of prostate cancer risk factors and clinical practice guidelines in the use of PSA than urologists, which makes them less likely to follow available recommendations. A need to carry out education interventions with trusted resources based on the available evidence and the current guidelines was identified.","[Estevan-Ortega, Maria] Univ Miguel Hernandez de Elche, Pharm Fac, Alicante, Spain; [de la Encarnacion Castellano, Cristina; Mendiola-Lopez, Alberto; Caballero-Romeu, Juan Pablo] Univ Gen Hosp Alicante, Dept Urol, Alicante, Spain; [Parker, Lucy A.; Lumbreras, Blanca] Univ Miguel Hernandez de Elche, Dept Publ Hlth, Alicante, Spain; [Parker, Lucy A.; Lumbreras, Blanca] CIBER Epidemiol & Salud Publ CIBERESP, Madrid, Spain; [Caballero-Romeu, Juan Pablo] Alicante Inst Hlth & Biomed Res ISABIAL, Alicante, Spain",Universidad Miguel Hernandez de Elche; General University Hospital of Alicante; Universidad Miguel Hernandez de Elche; CIBER - Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red; CIBERESP; General University Hospital of Alicante; Universidad Miguel Hernandez de Elche; Universitat d'Alacant; Instituto de Investigacion Sanitaria y Biomedica de Alicante (ISABIAL),"Lumbreras, B (corresponding author), Univ Miguel Hernandez de Elche, Dept Publ Hlth, Alicante, Spain.;Lumbreras, B (corresponding author), CIBER Epidemiol & Salud Publ CIBERESP, Madrid, Spain.",blumbreras@umh.es,,,Instituto de Salud Carlos III10.13039/501100004587,Instituto de Salud Carlos III10.13039/501100004587,No Statement Available,,44,0,0,0,1,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",,2296-858X,,FRONT MED-LAUSANNE,Front.

However, the impact of diabetes mellitus (DM) on the periapical healing (PH) outcome in diabetic patients remains somewhat unclear. This review aimed to evaluate the PH outcome following endodontic intervention among DM-afflicted individuals. Methods: A comprehensive search was conducted across multiple electronic databases to identify relevant studies. Specifically, a set of selection criteria was applied to select studies that assessed PH outcomes in individuals with DM who underwent different treatment protocols. Data extraction and quality assessment were performed following predetermined protocols. The risk of bias (RoB) 2 assessment tool evaluated the quality of the included studies. Results: A total of 11 studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the investigation. Four studies showed a higher incidence of apical periodontitis in diabetic individuals compared to controls, and five studies reported reduced healing and success rates in this group. Overall, nine studies have shown that DM has a negative impact on periapical outcomes. This suggests that DM is an important factor in the prognosis of endodontic intervention. The assessment tools used were PAI, PR, SC, and FD analysis. RoB-2 assessed the included studies as having a moderate RoB. Conclusion: This review provides compelling evidence that DM patients experienced a noticeable negative impact on PH outcomes compared to the control population. These findings highlight the importance of considering the diabetic status of patients when assessing the prognosis of periapical diseases and planning interventions for NEI. Further research is needed to validate these results and explore potential mechanisms underlying the observed associations.","[Viswanath, Butta; Priyank, Harsh] Rajendra Inst Med Sci, Dent Inst, Dept Conservat Endodont & Aesthet Dent, Ranchi, India; [Shivakumar, Sahana] Peoples Univ, Peoples Coll Dent Sci & Res Ctr, Publ Hlth Dent, Bhopal, India; [Langaliya, Akshayraj] AMC Dent Coll & Hosp, Dept Conservat Dent & Endodont, Ahmadabad, Gujarat, India; [Kumbhar, Aravind D.] Superintendent Community Hlth Ctr, Dept Dent, Kotarvada, Gujarat, India; [Jakhar, Ashima] Bharati Vidyapeeth Dent Coll & Hosp, Navi Mumbai, India; [Cervino, Gabriele] Univ Messina, Sch Dent, Dept Biomed & Dent Sci & Morphofunct Imaging, Via Consolare Valeria 1, I-98125 Messina, Italy; [Minervini, Giuseppe] Saveetha Univ, Saveetha Inst Med & Tech Sci, Saveetha Dent Coll & Hosp, Chennai 600077, India; [Minervini, Giuseppe] Univ Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Multidisciplinary Dept Med Surg & Odontostomatol S, I-80121 Naples, Italy",People's University; People's College of Dental Sciences & Research Centre; Bharati Vidyapeeth Deemed University; University of Messina; Saveetha Institute of Medical & Technical Science; Saveetha Dental College & Hospital; Universita della Campania Vanvitelli,"Priyank, H (corresponding author), Rajendra Inst Med Sci, Dent Inst, Dept Conservat Endodont & Aesthet Dent, Ranchi, India.;Minervini, G (corresponding author), Saveetha Univ, Saveetha Inst Med & Tech Sci, Saveetha Dent Coll & Hosp, Chennai 600077, India.;Minervini, G (corresponding author), Univ Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Multidisciplinary Dept Med Surg & Odontostomatol S, I-80121 Naples, Italy.",drbviswanath@gmail.com; hpriyank@gmail.com; sahana20579@gmail.com; ashima.jakhar@bharatividyapeeth.edu; aravind.kumbhar20@gmail.com; ashima.jakhar@bharatividyapeeth.edu; gcervino@unime.it; Giuseppe.minervini@unicampania.it,"Cervino, Gabriele/K-9418-2019; minervini, giuseppe/AAM-9828-2021; S, Sahana/JJD-7532-2023","Langaliya, Akshayraj/0000-0003-4015-1252",,,,,41,0,0,1,1,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1013-9052,1658-3558,,SAUDI DENT J,Saudi Dent.

While existing guidelines emphasize evidence-based treatments, the potential therapeutic role of thermal water (TW) inhalation remains under-investigated. Methods: This systematic review followed PRISMA-P guidelines and sought to evaluate the impact of TW in asthma and COPD. A thorough literature search, performed up to May 2023, encompassed in vitro, in vivo, randomized controlled trial (RCT), non-RCT, and observational studies. Results: The review included 12 studies reporting different findings. In vitro studies suggested TW could enhance antioxidant capacity and cell proliferation. In a murine model of non-atopic asthma, TW inhalation reduced airway hyperresponsiveness and inflammation. RCTs in COPD patients indicated mixed effects, including improved quality of life, reduced airway oxidant stress, and enhanced exercise tolerance. Asthma patients exposed to water aerosols exhibited improved lung function and reduced airway inflammation. Non-RCTs showed improved lung function and antioxidant activity after TW therapy. Additionally, observational studies reported enhanced lung function and reduced airway inflammation. Conclusion: The current evidence suggests potential benefits of TW therapy in asthma and COPD. However, limited high-quality RCTs and concerns regarding occupational TW exposure necessitate further investigation. While TW therapy offers a non-invasive treatment, its therapeutic potential still needs definitive demonstration. Future research should therefore prioritize well-designed RCTs to thoroughly establish the efficacy and safety of TW as a potential therapeutic intervention for asthma and COPD.","[Calzetta, Luigino; Chetta, Alfredo] Univ Parma, Dept Med & Surg, Resp Dis & Lung Funct Unit, I-43126 Parma, Italy; [Di Daniele, Nicola] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Dept Syst Med, I-00133 Rome, Italy; [Di Daniele, Nicola] Policlin Abano, Fdn Leonardo Sci Med Onlus, I-35031 Abano Terme, Italy; [Chetta, Alfredo] Univ Hosp Parma, Cardiothorac & Vasc Dept, I-43126 Parma, Italy; [Vitale, Marco] Univ Vita Salute San Raffaele, Fac Med, I-20132 Milan, Italy; [Vitale, Marco] Italian Fdn Res Balneol FoRST, I-00198 Rome, Italy; [Gholamalishahi, Shima; Cazzola, Mario; Rogliani, Paola] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Dept Expt Med, Unit Resp Med, I-00133 Rome, Italy",University of Parma; University of Rome Tor Vergata; University of Parma; University Hospital of Parma; Vita-Salute San Raffaele University; University of Rome Tor Vergata,"Calzetta, L (corresponding author), Univ Parma, Dept Med & Surg, Resp Dis & Lung Funct Unit, I-43126 Parma, Italy.",luigino.calzetta@unipr.it; didaniele@med.uniroma2.it; alfredoantonio.chetta@unipr.it; marco.vitale@unipr.it; shima.gholamalishahi@uniroma2.it; mario.cazzola@uniroma2.it; paola.rogliani@uniroma2.it,"Cazzola, Mario/ABD-9998-2021; Calzetta, Luigino/K-4516-2016","Calzetta, Luigino/0000-0003-0456-069X; Rogliani, Paola/0000-0001-7801-5040",,,,,32,1,1,0,0,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2077-0383,,J CLIN MED,J.

The manifestation depends on the form: in mild conditions, occasionally, vesicularbullous lesions of the oral cavity may be present, which heal spontaneously without leaving scars. Patients following joint rupture have scars that limit food intake and restrict quality of life. This study aims to evaluate the possibility of carrying out an implant therapy and the success rate of this therapy. Methods: Until January 3, 2000, PubMed, Web of Science, and Lilacs were searched. Clinical studies were selected that considered implant therapy in patients with epidermolysis bullosa. Articles were therefore selected that addressed oral health and implant survival in patients with epidermolysis, with no differentiation between the various subtypes. A risk of bias assessment was performed through Cochrane. Results: Twenty-one studies were found after the investigation. Only five were chosen to create the current systematic study; 16 articles were skipped over. 10 papers were disregarded because they had been reviewed; 4 were ignored because they contained case studies; and two were omitted because they were not written in English. The results show that implant survival is at around 97%. Conclusions: Patients with epidermolysis bullosa can be treated with implant therapy without the risk of an increased implant failure rate.

The growing emphasis on sustainable business practices has led entrepreneurship research to identify entrepreneurship-related sustainability as a critical subfield. However, the inconsistent terminology used, such as green entrepreneurship, ecopreneurship, and entrepreneurship (ENP), reflects the fragmented nature of research in this area. A Systematic Literature Review on entrepreneurship-related sustainability was conducted to address this, focusing on the term enviropreneurship and applying PRISMA guidelines for transparency and methodological standardization. A total of 67 research articles published between 2013 and 2022 were analyzed to identify key themes and subthemes. This analysis resulted in a comprehensive definition of ENP and a cohesive research agenda for the future. The findings revealed significant shortcomings in standardized reporting procedures, highlighting the need for greater methodological openness and harmonization. To address this, the widespread adoption of PRISMA principles adapted to the specific needs of ENP research is advocated to enhance rigour, comparability, and reliability in this multidisciplinary field. Categorizing the research articles provided valuable insights into the research direction and specific focus areas, revealing a shift towards practical application and evaluation alongside conceptual exploration and analysis, which is inherent to any research field.","[Albhirat, Muath Maqbool; Zulkiffli, Siti Nur Atikah; Zia-ul-Haq, Hafiz Muhammad] Univ Malaysia Terengganu, Fac Business Econ & Social Dev, Kuala Nerus, Malaysia; [Rashid, Aamir] City Univ New York CUNY, Dept Business & Econ, Sch Business & Informat Syst, York Coll, Jamaica, NY USA; [Rasheed, Rizwana] Iqra Univ, Dept Business Adm, Main Campus, Karachi, Pakistan; [Rasool, Shahid] Univ Teknol Malaysia, Azman Hashim Int Business Sch, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; [Mohammad, Al Montaser] Zarqa Univ, Fac Econ & Adm Sci, Zarqa 13110, Jordan",Universiti Malaysia Terengganu; City University of New York (CUNY) System; York College NY (CUNY); Iqra University; Universiti Teknologi Malaysia; Zarqa University,"Rasheed, R (corresponding author), Iqra Univ, Dept Business Adm, Main Campus, Karachi, Pakistan.",muathalbhirat@outlook.com; arashid6@york.cuny.edu; prof.rizwana1@gmail.com; rasoolshahid@utm.my; atikahzulkiffli@umt.edu.my; muhammad_ziaulhaq@hotmail.com; Almontaser@zu.edu.jo,"GANIEE, SHAHID/IUN-3425-2023; mohammad, Al Montaser/ACX-1769-2022; R, Aamir/AAN-1381-2021; Zia-ul-haq, Hafiz Muhammad/AAY-3519-2020","Zia-ul-haq, Hafiz Muhammad/0000-0001-9345-7445; Mohammad, Al Montaser/0000-0001-5822-9586",,,,,118,14,14,3,10,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",2666-7908,,,CLEAN ENG TECHNOL,Cleaner Eng.

In recent years, there has been growing interest in understanding the relationship between bruxism and alcohol abuse, as both are prevalent issues that may share underlying factors and exacerbate each other. This systematic review, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement, aims to evaluate the frequency of bruxism among individuals with alcohol abuse.MethodsA comprehensive search of electronic databases, including PubMed, Lilacs, Scopus and Web of Science, will be conducted to identify relevant studies published up to the knowledge cutoff date in January 2023. The search strategy will include keywords related to bruxism, alcohol abuse, and their synonyms. Inclusion criteria will encompass original research studies, such as observational, cross-sectional, cohort, and case-control studies, as well as clinical trials, that examine the relationship between bruxism and alcohol abuse. Two independent reviewers will perform the study selection, data extraction, and quality assessment, with discrepancies resolved by consensus.ResultsThe systematic review will present a summary of the identified studies, including the study design, characteristics of the study populations, and key findings related to the association between bruxism and alcohol abuse. The potential mechanisms underlying this relationship will also be explored. Subgroup analyses and the quality of evidence will be assessed. Finally, the implications of this association for clinical practice and further research will be discussed.ConclusionsThis systematic review will contribute to a better understanding of the interplay between bruxism and alcohol abuse, shedding light on potential risk factors, mechanisms, and clinical implications. The findings may have significant implications for the prevention, management, and treatment of bruxism, particularly in individuals with a history of alcohol abuse.","[Ronsivalle, Vincenzo; Cicciu, Marco] Catania Univ, Dept Biomed & Surg & Biomed Sci, I-95123 Catania, Italy; [Marrapodi, Maria Maddalena] Univ Campania, Dept Biomed & Surg & Biomed Sci, I-80138 Naples, Italy; [Siurkel, Yuliia] Int European Univ, Sch Med, Akademika Hlushkova Ave 42В, UA-03187 Kiev, Ukraine; [Minervini, Giuseppe] Saveetha Univ, Saveetha Dent Coll & Hosp, Saveetha Inst Med & Tech Sci SIMATS, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India; [Minervini, Giuseppe] Univ Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Multidisciplinary Dept Med Surg & Dent Specialties, I-80138 Naples, Italy",University of Catania; Universita della Campania Vanvitelli; International European University; Saveetha Institute of Medical & Technical Science; Saveetha Dental College & Hospital; Universita della Campania Vanvitelli,"Siurkel, Y (corresponding author), Int European Univ, Sch Med, Akademika Hlushkova Ave 42В, UA-03187 Kiev, Ukraine.",yuliasiurkel@ieu.edu.ua,"minervini, giuseppe/AAM-9828-2021; Ronsivalle, Vincenzo/HJA-6104-2022; Cicciù, Marco/AAO-6713-2020",,,,,,53,1,1,3,4,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",1472-6831,,,BMC ORAL HEALTH,BMC Oral Health,JAN 18,2024,24,1,,,,,,,108,10.1186/s12903-024-03862-1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12903-024-03862-1,,,10,"Dentistry, Oral Surgery & Medicine",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),"Dentistry, Oral Surgery & Medicine",FJ5U0,38238683,"gold, Green Published",,,2024-11-25,WOS:001145414800004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Due to the rapid development of technology, tourism has seen some critical changes in how people interact with the industry. By applying artificial intelligence (AI) to different aspects of the tourism business, it is possible to increase efficiency by using resources more effectively. This paper aims to provide insights into how AI technologies can be applied to different aspects of tourism operations and services to improve the customer experience both online and offline and at service providers such as hotels. A literature review is conducted based on the PRISMA methodology by running searches on databases Scopus and Web of Science. This research contributes to providing an overview of how current AI technologies are used in the tourism industry and how they may be used in the fu- ture to enhance customers' experiences when interacting with different aspects of tourism. It also examines various concerns that need further investigation before adoption can occur. The review shows that the application of AI technologies can improve numerous facets of tourism operations and services, resulting in numerous advantages.","[Henriques, Henrique Jose Gonsalves; Almeida, Claudia Ribeiro de; Ramos, Celia Maria Quiterio] Res Ctr Tourism Sustainabil & Well being CinTurs, Faro, Portugal; [Henriques, Henrique Jose Gonsalves; Almeida, Claudia Ribeiro de; Ramos, Celia Maria Quiterio] Univ Algarve, Sch Hospitality & Management ESGHT, Faro, Portugal",Universidade do Algarve,"Henriques, HJG (corresponding author), Res Ctr Tourism Sustainabil & Well being CinTurs, Faro, Portugal.;Henriques, HJG (corresponding author), Univ Algarve, Sch Hospitality & Management ESGHT, Faro, Portugal.",hjhenriques@ualg.pt,"Henriques, Henrique/GXA-3228-2022; Ramos, Célia/C-5119-2012","Henriques, Henrique/0000-0002-5543-766X",FCT- Foundation for Science and Technology [UIDB/04020/2020],FCT- Foundation for Science and Technology(Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)),This paper is financed by National Funds provided by FCT- Foundation for Science and Technology through project UIDB/04020/2020.,,75,2,2,13,27,CINTURS-RESEARCH CENTRE TOURISM SUSTAINABILITY & WELL-BEING,FARO,"UNIV ALGARVE, GAMBELAS CAMPUS, FAC ECONOMICS, BLDG 9, OFF 2 76, FARO, PORTUGAL",2795-5044,,,J TOUR SUSTAIN WELL,J.

However, we have identified several issues that point to an over-reliance on the PRISMA guidelines. Firstly, we question the rigor of implementation by authors and the rigor of verification by peer reviewers and editors, and whether they have screened papers to ensure adherence to the PRISMA guidelines. Secondly, we have identified cases where the PRISMA criteria led to as much as 99.97% of the published literature being ignored, suggesting that valid publications meeting these criteria might be at risk of being ignored. Thirdly, we have noted that exclusion is not only a quantitative problem-it is also a qualitative one, since the screening procedure groups all non-conforming literature into one basket. Fourthly, we have noted that seven copies of the PRISMA guidelines exist. This being the case, which one should be cited? To replace over-reliance on PRISMA screening, we encourage authors, peer reviewers, and editors to publish systematic reviews and meta-analyses that respect the dual criteria of scientific plausibility and diversity of included papers.","[Teixeira da Silva, Jaime A.; Daly, Timothy] FLACSO Argentina, Bioeth Program, Buenos Aires, Argentina; [Daly, Timothy] Sorbonne Univ, Sci Norms Democracy, Paris, France",Sorbonne Universite,"Teixeira da Silva, JA (corresponding author), FLACSO Argentina, Bioeth Program, Buenos Aires, Argentina.",jaimetex@yahoo.com,"Daly, Timothy/IQV-9656-2023",,,,,,13,0,0,2,2,RAMBAM HEALTH CARE CAMPUS,HAIFA,"6 HA ALIYA ST, HAIFA, 31096, ISRAEL",2076-9172,,,RAMBAM MAIMONIDES ME,Rambam Maimonides Med.

For this reason, the use and adoption of ICTs aimed at university student learning was examined through a systematic review using PRISMA methodology; this review included 27 articles that met the inclusion criteria. The results showed that the most used factor was the perceived usefulness of ICTs in receiving training. In turn, due to the conditions presented during the pandemic, variables such as fear and technological complexity were prominent to address needs in specific contexts. Thus, students were driven by current conditions, developing, and strengthening digital communication and collaboration skills to meet learning objectives. Among the emerging themes in the subject, elements related to immersive technologies, which include augmented reality and virtual reality, are observed. The results provide theoretical contributions and allow identifying relevant variables for technology adoption, such as attitude towards use, perceived ease, intention to use, perceived usefulness, perceived fear, satisfaction or enjoyment, and technological complexity. These findings have practical implications for formulating models focused on current academic needs and can guide research on technology adoption by higher education students.","[Valencia-Arias, Alejandro] Univ Senor Sipan, Escuela Ingn Ind, Chiclayo 14001, Peru; [Lopez-Sanchez, Jerri Alejandro] Univ Antioquia, Div Innovac, Vicerrectoria Extens, Medellin, Colombia; [Patino-Vanegas, Juan Camilo] Inst Tecnol Metropolitano, Fac Ciencias Econ & Adm, Medellin, Colombia; [Valencia-Arias, Alejandro] Univ Senor Sipan, Escuela Ingn Ind, Chiclayo, Peru; [Valencia, Jackeline] Univ Ricardo Palma, Inst Invest & Estudios Mujer, Lima, Peru",Universidad Senor de Sipan; Universidad de Antioquia; Universidad Senor de Sipan; Universidad Ricardo Palma,"Valencia-Arias, A (corresponding author), Univ Senor Sipan, Escuela Ingn Ind, Chiclayo 14001, Peru.",valenciajho@uss.edu.pe,"Arias, Alejandro/I-9436-2019; López-Sánchez, Jerri/IUO-0993-2023; Valencia Arias, Jhoany Alejandro/E-5174-2017","Lopez Sanchez, Jerri Alejandro/0000-0001-5965-3469; Valencia Arias, Jhoany Alejandro/0000-0001-9434-6923",UNIVERSIDAD SENOR DE SIPAN,UNIVERSIDAD SENOR DE SIPAN,This work was supported by the UNIVERSIDAD SENOR DE SIPAN.,,85,3,3,3,13,TAYLOR & FRANCIS AS,OSLO,"KARL JOHANS GATE 5, NO-0154 OSLO, NORWAY",2331-186X,,,COGENT EDUC,Cogent Educ.,DEC 11,2023,10,2,,,,,,,2288490,10.1080/2331186X.2023.2288490,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/2331186X.2023.2288490,,,22,Education & Educational Research,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Education & Educational Research,AS0H3,,gold,,,2024-11-25,WOS:001120325000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

L2 learning, especially when it comes to learning some of the most spoken languages in the world, is increasingly including more and more automated methods to assess linguistics aspects and provide feedback to learners, especially on pronunciation issues. On the one hand, only a few of these systems integrate automatic speech recognition as a helping tool for pronunciation assessment. On the other hand, most of the computer-assisted language pronunciation tools focus on the segmental level of the language, providing feedback on specific phonetic pronunciation, and disregarding the suprasegmental features based on intonation, among others. The current review, based on the PRISMA methodology for systematic reviews, overviews the existing tools for L2 learning, classifying them in terms of the assessment level, (grammatical, lexical, phonetic, and prosodic), and trying the explain why so few tools are nowadays dedicated to evaluate the intonational aspect. Moreover, the review also addresses the existing commercial systems, as well as the existing gap between those tools and the research developed in this area. Finally, the manuscript finishes with a discussion of the main findings and foresees future lines of research.","[Farrus, Mireia] Univ Barcelona, Ctr Llenguatge Computacio CL i, Barcelona 08007, Spain; [Farrus, Mireia] Univ Barcelona, Inst Recerca Sistemes Complexos UBICS, Barcelona 08028, Spain",University of Barcelona; University of Barcelona,"Farrús, M (corresponding author), Univ Barcelona, Ctr Llenguatge Computacio CL i, Barcelona 08007, Spain.;Farrús, M (corresponding author), Univ Barcelona, Inst Recerca Sistemes Complexos UBICS, Barcelona 08028, Spain.",mfarrus@ub.edu,"Farrús, Mireia/O-1402-2019; Farrus, Mireia/K-5525-2017","Farrus, Mireia/0000-0002-7160-9513",Generalitat de Catalunya,Generalitat de Catalunya(Generalitat de Catalunya),No Statement Available,,60,3,3,3,11,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,2226-471X,,LANGUAGES-BASEL,Languages-Basel,DEC,2023,8,4,,,,,,,242,10.3390/languages8040242,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/languages8040242,,,13,Linguistics; Language & Linguistics,Emerging Sources Citation Index (ESCI),Linguistics,DG9Q2,,gold,,,2024-11-25,WOS:001130997800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

TMD is a multifactorial condition characterised by pain and dysfunction in the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) and surrounding structures. Salivary biomarkers have emerged as potential diagnostic tools due to their non-invasiveness and easy accessibility. However, the literature on salivary biomarkers in relation to TMD is limited and inconsistent.MethodsElectronic databases of Pubmed, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, Cochrane Library, PsychINFO, CINAHL and Medline were searched using specific search terms and Boolean operators. The search was limited to articles published in English that assessed salivary biomarkers in individuals diagnosed with TMD. Two reviewers independently screened the articles and extracted data. ROB-2 was used to assess the risk of bias.ResultsEleven clinical papers met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. The findings provided consistent evidence of a clear association between salivary biomarkers and TMD. Various biomarkers, including cortisol, IL-1, glutamate and several others, were assessed. Some studies reported higher levels of cortisol and IL-1 in TMD patients, indicating potential involvement in stress and inflammation. Glutamate levels were found to be elevated, suggesting a role in pain modulation. Other biomarkers also showed alterations in TMD patients compared to controls:ConclusionThe findings from the included studies suggest that salivary biomarkers may play a role in TMD pathophysiology. Though a definitive conclusion can be drawn regarding the specific salivary biomarkers and their association with TMD, the results must be interpreted with caution considering the heterogeneity of the biomarkers assessed. Further research with larger sample sizes, standardised methodology and rigorous study designs is needed to elucidate the role of salivary biomarkers in TMD.","[Alam, Mohammad Khursheed] Jouf Univ, Coll Dent, Prevent Dent Dept, Sakaka 72345, Saudi Arabia; [Alam, Mohammad Khursheed; Minervini, Giuseppe] Saveetha Univ, Saveetha Inst Med & Tech Sci, Saveetha Dent Coll & Hosp, Chennai, India; [Alam, Mohammad Khursheed] Daffodil Int Univ, Fac Allied Hlth Sci, Dept Publ Hlth, Dhaka, Bangladesh; [Zaman, Mahmud Uz; Alqhtani, Nasser Raqe] Prince Sattam Bin Abdullaziz Univ, Coll Dent, Dept Oral & Maxillofacial Surg & Diagnost Sci, Al Kharj, Saudi Arabia; [Alqahtani, Abdullah Saad] Prince Sattam Bin Abdulaziz Univ, Coll Dent, Dept Prevent Dent Sci, Al Kharj, Saudi Arabia; [Alqahtani, Abdullah Saad] Prince Sattam bin Abdulaziz Univ, Sch Dent, Dept Prosthodont, Al Kharj, Saudi Arabia; [Cicciu, Marco] Catania Univ, Dept Biomed & Surg & Biomed Sci, Catania, Italy; [Minervini, Giuseppe] Univ Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Multidisciplinary Dept Med Surg & Odontostomatol S, Naples, Italy",Al Jouf University; Saveetha Institute of Medical & Technical Science; Saveetha Dental College & Hospital; Daffodil International University; Prince Sattam Bin Abdulaziz University; Prince Sattam Bin Abdulaziz University; Prince Sattam Bin Abdulaziz University; University of Catania; Universita della Campania Vanvitelli,"Alam, MK (corresponding author), Jouf Univ, Coll Dent, Prevent Dent Dept, Sakaka 72345, Saudi Arabia.;Minervini, G (corresponding author), Univ Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Multidisciplinary Dept Med Surg & Odontostomatol S, Naples, Italy.",mkalam@ju.edu.sa; giuseppe.minervini@unicampania.it,"Cicciù, Marco/AAO-6713-2020; Alam, Mohammad/GQR-2648-2022; Alqhtani, Nasser/GSJ-2602-2022; minervini, giuseppe/AAM-9828-2021; Zaman, Mahmud Uz/GXV-0995-2022; Alqahtani, Fawaz/HGU-2844-2022; Alqahtani, Abdullah S/GRX-4829-2022","Alqahtani, Abdullah S/0000-0003-0474-7067; Zaman, Mahmud Uz/0000-0001-7364-530X",,,,,66,1,1,2,5,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0305-182X,1365-2842,,J ORAL REHABIL,J.

This could potentially contribute to the development or exacerbation of TMD symptoms. The literature on the long-term impact of MAD treated for OSA on TMD is scarce. Hence, this review was undertaken to ascertain the occurrence of TMD in MAD users.Methods: A comprehensive search protocol was implemented across several online databases using MeSH keywords and Boolean operators. A standardised data extraction form was developed specifically for this review. Two reviewers independently extracted the data. RoB-2 was used to evaluate the methodological quality of the included studies.Results: A total of 13 clinical studies were selected for this review. Some studies reported a significant reduction in the severity and frequency of TMD symptoms following MAD treatment. However, other studies did not observe significant changes in TMD symptoms or TMJ-related parameters from baseline to follow-up intervals. Temporary increases in TMJ-related pain or symptoms at the beginning of the follow-up period, which later subsided, were reported in some studies. Overall, MAD was not discontinued in any OSA patient due to TMDs.Conclusion: The findings reveal that different outcomes associated with TMD are affected differently by MAD treatment for OSAS. According to a few studies, MAD therapy significantly reduced the severity and frequency of TMD symptoms. Other research, however, found no appreciable modifications in TMD symptoms or TMJ-related indicators. Although the overall results point to no significant effect of MAD treatment on TMD symptoms, the disparity in results between studies highlights the need for additional studies using standardised approaches.","[Langaliya, Akshayraj] AMC Dent Coll & Hosp, Dept Conservat Dent & Endodont, Ahmadabad, Gujarat, India; [Alam, Mohammad Khursheed] Jouf Univ, Coll Dent, Prevent Dent Dept, Orthodont Div, Sakakah, Saudi Arabia; [Hegde, Usha] JSS Acad Higher Educ & Res, JSS Dent Coll & Hosp Mysore, Dept Oral Pathol & Microbiol, Mysore, India; [Panakaje, Mangesh Shenoy] Nitte Deemed Univ, AB Shetty Mem Inst Dent Sci, Constituent Coll, Affiliated Coll,Dept Oral & Maxillofacial Pathol &, Mangalore, Karnataka, India; [Cervino, Gabriele] Univ Messina, Sch Dent, Dept Biomed & Dent Sci & Morphofunct Imaging, Messina, Italy; [Minervini, Giuseppe] Univ Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Multidisciplinary Dept Med Surg & Odontostomatol S, Naples, Italy",Al Jouf University; JSS Academy of Higher Education & Research; NITTE (Deemed to be University); A.B.

Understanding the prevalence of bruxism among OSA patients is crucial for identifying possible comorbidities and optimising treatment strategies. ObjectiveThis systematic review aimed at analysing the prevalence of SB in OSAS sufferers and understanding the association between the two. MethodsFive online databases were searched for relevant articles in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines for conduction of systematic reviews. Studies reporting the prevalence of bruxism in OSAS patients and diagnosed through clinical assessments or polysomnography were included. Data extraction and quality assessment were performed independently by two reviewers. Methodological quality of the included studies was assessed using Risk of Bias In Non-randomised Studies of Interventions (ROBINS-I). ResultsA thorough search of literature yielded only two studies were eligible for this review. SB was found to be significantly present in the OSAS group. Despite methodological variations, the majority of studies reported higher rates of bruxism in OSAS patients compared to the general population or control groups. ConclusionThe results of this systematic review point to a significant association between bruxism and obstructive sleep apnea. Further research is required to determine a more precise prevalence rate and investigate the potential therapeutic implications of the bruxism-OSAS association that uses a standardised assessment techniques and larger sample sizes.","[Alshahrani, Ahid Amer; Alshadidi, Abdulkhaliq Ali F.] King Khalid Univ, Coll Appl Med Sci, Dept Dent Technol, Abha, Saudi Arabia; [Alamri, Mazen Awadh A.; Alamri, Abdullah Awadh A.] King Khalid Univ Abha, Coll Dent, Abha, Saudi Arabia; [Alshehri, Abdullah Hassan J.; Cicciu, Marco; Isola, Gaetano] Univ Catania, Sch Dent, Dept Gen Surg & Surg Med Specialties, Catania, Italy; [Minervini, Giuseppe] Univ Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Multidisciplinary Dept Med Surg & Odontostomatol S, I-80121 Naples, Italy",King Khalid University; King Khalid University; University of Catania; Universita della Campania Vanvitelli,"Alshadidi, AAF (corresponding author), King Khalid Univ, Coll Appl Med Sci, Dept Dent Technol, Abha, Saudi Arabia.;Minervini, G (corresponding author), Univ Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Multidisciplinary Dept Med Surg & Odontostomatol S, I-80121 Naples, Italy.",aalshadidi@kku.edu.sa; giuseppe.minervini@unicampania.it,"minervini, giuseppe/AAM-9828-2021; Alshahrani, Ahid/JPK-2487-2023; Cicciù, Marco/AAO-6713-2020; Isola, Gaetano/H-2878-2019; Alshadidi, Abdulkhaliq/HJY-6801-2023","Okshah, Abdulmajeed/0009-0002-7597-1672; Isola, Gaetano/0000-0003-4267-6992; ALSHAHRANI, Ahid/0000-0002-8496-184X; Alshadidi, Abdulkhaliq/0000-0002-1121-1917",Deanship of Scientific Research at King Khalid University [RGP2/452/44],Deanship of Scientific Research at King Khalid University(King Khalid UniversityKing Saud University),ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The authors extend their appreciation to the Deanship of Scientific Research at King Khalid University for funding this work through large group Research Project under grant number RGP2/452/44.,,40,6,6,3,9,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0305-182X,1365-2842,,J ORAL REHABIL,J.

Several types of biomass heat treatment methods have been introduced to obtain useful byproducts via pyrolysis. Microwaves are a practical replacement for conventional stoves and ovens to perform pyrolysis of biomass. Their rapid heating rate and user-friendliness make them a good choice for the pyrolysis process over conventional methods. The current study reviewed research articles that used microwaves for the pyrolysis process on different types of biomass. This study primarily provides comprehensive details about the pyrolysis process, especially microwave-assisted pyrolysis (MAP) and its feasibility for treating biomass. A systematic literature review, according to the PRISMA guidelines, was performed to find research articles on biomass treatment using MAP technology. We analyzed various research studies (n = 32), retrieved from different databases, that used MAP for pyrolysis on various types of biomass, and we achieved good results. The main goal of this study was to examine the usefulness of the MAP technique, comparing its effects on distinguished types of biomass. We found MAP's effective parameters, namely, temperature, concentration of microwave absorber, moisture percentage of starting material and flow rate, microwave power and residence time of the initial sweep gas that control the pyrolysis process, and effect quality of byproducts. The catalytic agent in MAP pyrolysis was found to be useful for treating biomass, and that it has great potential to increase (nearly double) the production yield. Although MAP could not be used for all types of materials due to some challenges, it produced good results compared to conventional heating (pyrolysis) methods. We concluded that MAP is an effective method for reducing pyrolysis reaction time and improving the quality of value-added products. Also, MAP eliminates the shredding requirement for biomass and improves heating quality. Therefore, it is a viable method for reducing pyrolysis processing costs and should be applied on a larger scale than lab scale for commercialization.","[Syed, Neyha Rubab; Zhang, Bo; Mwenya, Stephen; Aldeen, Awsan Shujaa] Southeast Univ, Sch Energy & Environm, 2 Sipailou, Nanjing 210096, Peoples R China",Southeast University - China,"Zhang, B (corresponding author), Southeast Univ, Sch Energy & Environm, 2 Sipailou, Nanjing 210096, Peoples R China.",223227104@seu.edu.cn; bozhang@seu.edu.cn; mwenya55674@seu.edu.cn; aldeen8745@seu.edu.cn,"Zhang, Bo/IZQ-3837-2023",,We are thankful to the Editor and reviewers for their helpful and constructive suggestions to improve the quality of this manuscript.

The primary goal of this review was to assess the effects of various orthognathic surgical techniques on the emergence or exacerbation of TMJ dysfunction. Methods: A comprehensive search was conducted across several databases using Boolean operators and MeSH keywords related to temporomandibular joint disorders (TMDs) and orthognathic surgical interventions, with no limitation on the year of publication. Two independent reviewers screened the identified studies based on predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria, followed by a risk of bias assessment using a standardised tool. Results: Five articles were considered for inclusion in this review. A greater number of females opted for surgical options than their male cohorts. Three studies were of prospective design, 1 of retrospective and 1 of observational type. Mobility on lateral excursion, tenderness on palpation, arthralgia and popping sounds were the TMD characteristics that showed significant differences. Overall, orthognathic surgical intervention did not show an increase in TMD signs and symptoms as compared to nonsurgical counterparts. Conclusion: Though orthognathic surgery reported greater cases of some TMD symptoms and signs as compared to the nonsurgical cohorts in four studies, the conclusive evidence is debatable. Further studies are recommended with a longer follow-up period and greater sample size to determine the impact of orthognathic surgery on TMJ.","[Abdul, Nishath Sayed] Riyadh Elm Univ, Fac Oral Pathol, Dept OMFS & Diagnost Sci, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia; [Minervini, Giuseppe] Univ Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Multidisciplinary Dept Med Surg & Dent Specialtie, Naples, Italy",Riyadh Elm University; Universita della Campania Vanvitelli,"Minervini, G (corresponding author), Univ Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Multidisciplinary Dept Med Surg & Dent Specialtie, Naples, Italy.",giuseppe.minervini@unicampania.it,"minervini, giuseppe/AAM-9828-2021",,,,,,43,2,2,2,4,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0305-182X,1365-2842,,J ORAL REHABIL,J.

In addition to addressing waste disposal difficulties, the inclusion of waste additives may improve the characteristics of compressed earth blocks (CEBs). This article attempts to outline the findings of researchers who have utilized the various manufacturing processes and investigated the influence of binders and fibers on the properties of CEBs. A systematic search of Web of Science and Scopus electronic databases for works on soil blocks published between 2012 and 2022 yielded 445 articles, while reports, case studies, conference papers, and non-English articles were omitted. Keywords such as Soil blocks, Earth bricks, and others were used to identify eligible studies. This study has been segmented into five sections, including a descriptive examination of articles and authors who have investigated soil blocks, a comparative analysis based on their manufacturing processes, and physical, mechanical, and durability aspects of the CSEBs, which were analyzed to determine the impact of additives. The PRISMA 2020 standards were followed in the evaluation of each record, which resulted in the identification of 61 articles that were pertinent to the study's objective. The comparative analysis of the articles reveals that the binders were more significant in improving the compressive strength, cyclic wetting-drying and erosion (durability) aspects of the soil blocks, while fibers were effective in enhancing their flexural and thermal performance.

There are several treatment approaches. There is the non-surgical and surgical approach. The purpose of this systematic literature review is to evaluate the indications and contraindications of either method to help the clinician make the best treatment choice. MethodsPubmed, Web of Science and Lilacs were systematically searched until 20 May 2023. Clinical trials were selected to compare the two treatments for condyle fracture and evaluate indications and contraindications. ResultsOut of 2515 papers, four studies were included. The surgical approach allows faster functional recovery and decreases patient discomfort. The study analyses under what circumstances a surgical procedure is more practical than a non-surgical one. ConclusionThere is no evidence regarding the reliability of either method. Both have superimposable results. However, age, type of occlusion and other factors direct the clinician towards a surgical choice.","[Minervini, Giuseppe] Univ Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Multidisciplinary Dept Med Surg & Odontostomatol, Naples, Italy; [Minervini, Giuseppe] Alexandria Univ, Fac Dent, Alexandria, Egypt; [Franco, Rocco] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Dept Biomed & Prevent, Rome, Italy; [Marrapodi, Maria Maddalena] Univ Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Dept Woman Child & Gen & Specialist Surg, Naples, Italy; [Di Blasio, Marco] Univ Parma, Univ Ctr Dent, Dept Med & Surg, Parma, Italy; [Isola, Gaetano; Cicciu, Marco] Catania Univ, Dept Biomed & Surg & Biomed Sci, Catania, Italy; Univ Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Multidisciplinary Dept Med Surg & Odontostomatol, I-80121 Naples, Italy",Universita della Campania Vanvitelli; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Alexandria University; University of Rome Tor Vergata; Universita della Campania Vanvitelli; University of Parma; University of Catania; Universita della Campania Vanvitelli,"Minervini, G (corresponding author), Univ Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Multidisciplinary Dept Med Surg & Odontostomatol, I-80121 Naples, Italy.",giuseppe.minervini@unicampania.it,"Franco, Rocco/IST-9900-2023; Cicciù, Marco/AAO-6713-2020; minervini, giuseppe/AAM-9828-2021; Di Blasio, Marco/IRY-9855-2023; Cicciu, Marco/Q-2671-2015; Isola, Gaetano/H-2878-2019","Cicciu, Marco/0000-0003-2311-9728; Isola, Gaetano/0000-0003-4267-6992; franco, rocco/0000-0002-2398-7843; MARRAPODI, MARIA MADDALENA/0000-0002-9494-6942",,,,,44,39,39,9,11,WILEY,HOBOKEN,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",0305-182X,1365-2842,,J ORAL REHABIL,J.

The aim of this study is to systematically assess the most prevalent clinical signs, symptoms and comorbidities of acromegaly at time of diagnosis.DesignA literature search (in PubMed, Embase and Web of Science) was performed on November 18, 2021, in collaboration with a medical information specialist.MethodsPrevalence data on (presenting) clinical signs, symptoms and comorbidities at time of diagnosis were extracted and synthesized as weighted mean prevalence. The risk of bias was assessed for each included study using the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist for Studies Reporting Prevalence Data.ResultsRisk of bias and heterogeneity was high in the 124 included articles. Clinical signs and symptoms with the highest weighted mean prevalence were: acral enlargement (90%), facial features (65%), oral changes (62%), headache (59%), fatigue/tiredness (53%; including daytime sleepiness: 48%), hyperhidrosis (47%), snoring (46%), skin changes (including oily skin: 37% and thicker skin: 35%), weight gain (36%) and arthralgia (34%). Concerning comorbidities, acromegaly patients more frequently had hypertension, left ventricle hypertrophy, dia/systolic dysfunction, cardiac arrhythmias, (pre)diabetes, dyslipidemia and intestinal polyps- and malignancy than age- and sex matched controls. Noteworthy, cardiovascular comorbidity was lower in more recent studies. Features that most often led to diagnosis of acromegaly were typical physical changes (acral enlargement, facial changes and prognatism), local tumor effects (headache and visual defect), diabetes, thyroid cancer and menstrual disorders.ConclusionAcromegaly manifests itself with typical physical changes but also leads to a wide variety of common comorbidities, emphasizing that recognition of a combination of these features is key to establishing the diagnosis.","[Slagboom, Tessa N.

Many therapy options are available but are not codified. Systematic reviews (SRs) and meta-analyses (MAs) are helpful to elaborate recommendations on the management of AGWs. The objective of our study was to assess the quality and consistency of SRs for the local management of AGWs using three international tools. MethodsSeven electronic databases were searched from inception to 10 January 2022 for this SR. The intervention of interest was any local treatment of AGWs. There was no restriction on language and population. The methodological quality, reporting quality and risk of bias (ROB) of the included SRs for the local treatments of AGWs were assessed independently by two investigators with A Measurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews version II (AMSTAR II), Risk of Bias in Systematic Reviews (ROBIS) and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA). ResultsTwenty-two SRs/MAs met all inclusion criteria. According to the results of the AMSTAR II, nine included reviews were rated critically as being of low quality, and only five were of high quality. Based on the ROBIS tool, only nine SRs/MAs had a low ROB. The domain-assessed 'study eligibility criteria' were mostly rated at a low ROB, unlike the other domains. With PRISMA, the reporting checklist was relatively complete for ten SRs/MAs, but some reporting weaknesses remained in the topics of the abstract, protocol and registration, ROB and funding. DiscussionSeveral therapy options are available for the local management of AGWs and are widely studied. However, due to the many ROB and low quality of these SRs/MAs, only a few of them have the sufficient methodological quality to support guidelines.

This review was designed to (a) systematically identify the evidence base of SRMA and to (b) critically appraise the quality of reporting according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Methods: Four databases were searched until August 2022 to systematically identify SRMA. PRISMA indicators were evaluated on a three-level response format to obtain an overall score operationalizing the quality of reporting (score range: 0-84). Additionally, the percentage of adherence to the PRISMA indicators was calculated. Results: Reporting quality of 23 SRMA, comprising 12 systematic reviews and 11 meta-analyses was evaluated. Quality scores ranged from 25 to 77 (M: 52.91; SD: 17.46). Results of the critical appraisal revealed deviations from the PRISMA indicators, including missing information on (a) registration of a study protocol, (b) statistical synthesis methods (c) evaluation of certainty of evidence, and (d) risk of bias assessment. Eleven (47.83%) of the SRMAs partially adhered, and twelve (52.17%) completely adhered to the PRISMA indicators. Conclusion: This first critical appraisal on the reporting quality of SRMA on treatment interventions for IUD highlights limitations of the evidence base. Inadequate reporting compromises the practical utility and validity of SRMA and may complicate ongoing efforts of consensus on evidence-based interventions for IUD. Future research should focus on sufficient and transparent reporting of the methodological approach.","[Basenach, Lara; Renneberg, Babette; Salbach, Harriet] Free Univ Berlin, Dept Educ & Psychol, Clin Psychol & Psychotherapy, Berlin, Germany; [Dreier, Michael; Woelfling, Klaus] Johannes Gutenberg Univ Mainz, Univ Med Ctr, Dept Psychosomat Med & Psychotherapy, Outpatient Clin Behav Addict, Mainz, Germany",Free University of Berlin; Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz,"Basenach, L (corresponding author), Free Univ Berlin, Dept Educ & Psychol, Clin Psychol & Psychotherapy, Berlin, Germany.",l.basenach@start-ptc.de,"Basenach, Lara/LCE-2978-2024","Basenach, Lara/0000-0002-9899-2022; Renneberg, Babette/0000-0003-2177-3566",,,,,63,8,9,1,3,AKADEMIAI KIADO ZRT,BUDAPEST,"BUDAFOKI UT 187-189-A-3, H-1117 BUDAPEST, HUNGARY",2062-5871,2063-5303,,J BEHAV ADDICT,J.

They are increasingly popular and have several stakeholders (e.g., healthcare providers, researchers, educators, stu-dents, journal editors, policy makers, managers) to whom they help make informed recommendations for practice or policy. Problem: Systematic reviews usually exhibit low methodological and reporting quality. To tackle this, reporting guidelines have been developed to support systematic reviews reporting and assessment. Following such guidelines is crucial to ensure that a review is transparent, complete, trustworthy, reproducible, and unbiased. However, systematic reviewers usually fail to adhere to existing reporting guidelines, which may significantly decrease the quality of the reviews they report and may result in systematic reviews that lack methodological rigor, yield low-credible findings and may mislead decision-makers. Methods: To assure that a review complies with reporting guidelines, we rely on assurance cases that are an emerging way of arguing and relaying various safety-critical systems' requirements in an extensive manner, as well as checking the compliance of such systems with standards to support their certification. Since the nature of assurance cases makes them applicable to various domains and requirements/properties, we therefore propose a new type of assurance cases called systematicity cases. Systematicity cases focus on the systematicity property and allow arguing that a review is systematic i.e., that it sufficiently complies with the targeted reporting guideline. The most widespread reporting guidelines include PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and meta-Analyses). We measure the confidence in a systematicity case representing a review as a means to quantify the systematicity of that review i.e., the extent to which that review is systematic. We rely on rule-based Artificial Intelligence to create a knowledge-based system that automatically supports the inference mechanism that a given systematicity case embodies and that allows making a decision regarding the systematicity of a given review. Results: An empirical evaluation performed on 25 reviews (self-identifying as systematic) showed that these reviews exhibit a suboptimal systematicity. More specifically, the systematicity of the analyzed reviews varies between 32.96% and 66.49% and its average is 54.42%. More efforts are therefore needed to report systematic reviews of higher quality. More experiments are also needed to further explore the factors hindering and/or assuring the systematicity of reviews.

The identified articles were assessed for completeness of reporting according to the PRISMA-DTA. Subgroup analyses were performed for association of completeness of reporting with multiple cofactors.Results: The search identified 183 reviews from 12 journals. The mean numbers (standard deviation) of reported PRISMA-DTA and PRISMA-DTA for Abstracts items in the full texts and abstracts were 18.45 (2.02) and 5.66 (1.28), respectively. Subgroup analysis showed that compared to the corresponding reference groups, a higher mean number of reported PRISMA-DTA items was associated with publi-cation during July 2018-December 2020 [(17.82 (2.01) vs 18.89 (1.91); p = 0.034), citation of the PRISMA-DTA [17.62 (1.86) vs 20.27 (2.02); p < 0.001], and inclusion of supplementary materials [17.64 (2) vs 19.09 (1.8); p < 0.001] on multiple-linear regression analysis.Conclusion: Completeness of reporting with respect to the PRISMA-DTA and PRISMA-DTA for Abstracts has improved modestly since the publication of the PRISMA-DTA guideline; however, increasing awareness of the specific weakness provides the chance for complete-ness improvement.","[Kim, Wook; Kim, Jun Ho; Cha, Yoon Ki; Chong, Semin; Kim, Tae Jung] Sungkyunkwan Univ, Samsung Med Ctr, Dept Radiol, Sch Med, 81 Irwon Ro, Seoul 06351, South Korea",Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU); Samsung Medical Center,"Kim, JH (corresponding author), Sungkyunkwan Univ, Samsung Med Ctr, Dept Radiol, Sch Med, 81 Irwon Ro, Seoul 06351, South Korea.",jhkim7227@gmail.com,"Kim, Jun/Q-8628-2019",,,,,,37,3,3,1,6,ELSEVIER SCIENCE INC,NEW YORK,"STE 800, 230 PARK AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10169 USA",1076-6332,1878-4046,,ACAD RADIOL,Acad.

CID is defined as any of the following condition: forced expiratory volume in 1 s decrease >= 100 mL from baseline, and/or St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire total score increase >= 4-unit from baseline, and/or the occurrence of a moderate-to-severe exacerbation of COPD. Although most COPD patients experience a clinical worsening as they get older, to date, no specific studies assessed the correlation between ageing and CID in COPD. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the impact of ageing on CID in COPD patients.Patients and Methods: Data obtained from 55219 COPD patients were extracted from 17 papers, mostly post-hoc analyses. A pairwise meta-analysis and a meta-regression analysis were performed according to PRISMA-P guidelines to quantify the impact of pharmacological therapy on CID and to determine whether ageing might modulate the risk of CID in COPD patients.Results: Inhaled treatments resulted generally effective in reducing the risk of CID in COPD (relative risk: 0.81, 95% confidence interval 0.79-0.84; P < 0.001). The meta-regression analysis indicated a trend toward significance (P = 0.063) in the linear relationship between age and the risk of CID. Of note, age significantly (P < 0.05) increased the risk of CID when associated with lower postbronchodilator FEV1. These results were not affected by a significant risk of bias.Conclusion: This quantitative synthesis suggests that inhaled therapy is effective in reducing the risk of CID in COPD, although such a protective effect may be affected in older patients with impaired lung function. Further studies specifically designed on CID in COPD are needed to confirm these results.","[Manzetti, Gian Marco; Ora, Josuel; Sepiacci, Arianna; Cazzola, Mario; Rogliani, Paola] Univ Roma Tor Vergata, Dept Expt Med, Unit Resp Med, Rome, Italy; [Calzetta, Luigino] Univ Parma, Dept Med & Surg, Resp Dis & Lung Funct Unit, Parma, Italy",University of Rome Tor Vergata; University of Parma,"Calzetta, L (corresponding author), Univ Parma, Dept Med & Surg, Resp Dis & Lung Funct Unit, Parma, Italy.",luigino.calzetta@unipr.it,"Cazzola, Mario/ABD-9998-2021; ora, josuel/K-8921-2016","ora, josuel/0000-0001-9877-7851; Rogliani, Paola/0000-0001-7801-5040; Manzetti, Gian Marco/0000-0002-8265-7959",,,,,63,1,1,0,0,DOVE MEDICAL PRESS LTD,ALBANY,"PO BOX 300-008, ALBANY, AUCKLAND 0752, NEW ZEALAND",1178-2005,,,INT J CHRONIC OBSTR,Int.

Universally accredited and indexed high-quality databases and university libraries; specifically, Scopus, PubMed, Science Direct, University of Toronto Library, and Google Scholar were used for retrieving published data (2000-2022). The titles Garlic and Ethiopia were used to retrieve articles. Microsoft Excel was used to summarize results. The present study indicated that a total of 12,000 publications from Google scholar, and 51 publications from the University of Toronto library search engine published on the web of science and Scopus were used. A total of 51 publications were chosen as being the most suitable for this paper. Among the 51 publications, 86%, 6%, 6%, and 2% were articles, Newsletter articles, Text resources, and conference proceedings, respectively. Accordingly, a study revealed that the low production of this crop is due to information obtained via a systematic review discussed and categorized as institutional determinants (15.69%), farmers' characteristics (9.8%), production and management practice (68.63%), and postharvest (5.88%). Institutional; production and management practices are of the major determinants negatively affecting garlic production in Ethiopia. Moreover, research limitations also were revealed.

The objective of this study is to systematically evaluate the effects of art therapy on schizophrenia and to determine whether there are some potential influencing factors affecting the effects of art therapy. Methods: Seven online databases will be searched from their inception until June 30, 2022. All the relevant randomized clinical trials (RCTs) comparing art therapy plus standardized treatment versus standardized treatment alone for schizophrenia will be selected and assessed for inclusion. The Cochrane risk-of-bias tool will be used to evaluate the methodological quality of the included RCTs. Review Manager 5.4 will be used to analyze all the data obtained. Mental health symptoms are defined as the primary outcome, and the secondary outcomes include the Global Assessment of Functioning score, quality of life, functional remission, and the level of self-esteem. Subgroup analyses will be performed based on the type of schizophrenia, severity of schizophrenia, type of art therapy, follow-up duration, or different populations. Results: The results will be published in a peer-reviewed journal. Conclusions: This updated systematic review and subgroup meta-analysis will evaluate the effects of art therapy as adjunctive treatment to standardized treatment in patients with schizophrenia and determine whether there are some potential confounding variables affecting the effects of art therapy on the outcomes of schizophrenia patients, thus strengthening the evidence base for the clinical application of this combination therapy for schizophrenia.","[Luo, Xuexing; Zhang, Zheyu; Zheng, Zhong; Ye, Qian; Huang, Guanghui] Macau Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Humanities & Arts, Ave Wai Long, Taipa 999078, Macau, Peoples R China; [Zheng, Zhong] Wuhan Technol & Business Univ, Coll Art & Design, Wuhan, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Ye, Qian] Jingdezhen China Ceram Museum, Jingdezhen, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Wang, Jue; Wu, Qibiao] Macau Univ Sci & Technol, State Key Lab Qual Res Chinese Med, Ave Wai Long, Taipa 999078, Macau, Peoples R China; [Wang, Jue; Wu, Qibiao] Macau Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Chinese Med, Taipa, Macau, Peoples R China; [Wu, Qibiao] Guangdong Hong Kong Macao Joint Lab Contaminants, Guangzhou, Guangdong, Peoples R China",Macau University of Science & Technology; Macau University of Science & Technology; Macau University of Science & Technology,"Huang, GH (corresponding author), Macau Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Humanities & Arts, Ave Wai Long, Taipa 999078, Macau, Peoples R China.;Wang, J; Wu, QB (corresponding author), Macau Univ Sci & Technol, State Key Lab Qual Res Chinese Med, Ave Wai Long, Taipa 999078, Macau, Peoples R China.",wangjue2014must@gmail.com; qbwu@must.edu.mo; ghhuang1@must.edu.mo,"QIBIAO, WU/AAA-7621-2019","Luo, Xuexing/0000-0001-9384-5931; Wu, Qibiao/0000-0002-1670-1050","Science and Technology Development Fund, Macau SAR [0098/2021/A2]; Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province [2020B1212030008]","Science and Technology Development Fund, Macau SAR; Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province","This work was supported by the Science and Technology Development Fund, Macau SAR (No.: 0098/2021/A2), and the Science and Technology Planning Project of Guangdong Province (2020B1212030008).",,44,2,2,8,38,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",0025-7974,1536-5964,,MEDICINE,Medicine (Baltimore),OCT 7,2022,101,40,,,,,,,e30935,10.1097/MD.0000000000030935,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/MD.0000000000030935,,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),General & Internal Medicine,5E3HL,36221342,"Green Published, gold",,,2024-11-25,WOS:000865518700026,View Full Record in Web of Science

Method: Following the guidelines of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses, all-grade and grade 3-5 of peripheral edema data extracted from clinical trials were taken into account for the final comprehensive assessments. Results: Twenty-seven PD-1/PD-L1-related clinical trials with peripheral edema data were collected. Compared with chemotherapy (PD-1/PD-L1 vs chemotherapy), the risk of developing peripheral edema for all-grade was much lower (odds ratio [OR] = 0.36, 95% confidence interval [CI]: [0.23, 0.56], Z = 4.55 [P < .00001]). When PD-1/PD-L1 plus chemotherapy were compared with chemotherapy, no significant analysis results for all-grade was found (OR = 1.15, 95% CI:[0.93, 1.44], I-2 = 25%, Z = 1.27 [P = .20]). Similar risk trends could also be found when the incidence risk of peripheral edema for grade 3-5 was evaluated. No obvious publication bias was identified throughout the total analysis process. Conclusion: The effect of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor on the risk of developing peripheral edema was weaker than that of chemotherapy, and the combination with chemotherapy slightly increased the incidence risk of developing peripheral edema without statistical significance.","[Tian, Yuan] Shandong Second Prov Gen Hosp, Radiotherapy Dept Oncol, Jinan 250023, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Huang, Alan] Shandong First Med Univ, Jinan Cent Hosp, Dept Oncol, Jinan 250013, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Tian, Mei] Shandong Univ Tradit Chinese Med, Affiliated Hosp, Resp Dept, Jinan 250014, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Wang, Kaiyong] Peoples Hosp Yuncheng Cty, Dept Resp & Crit Cate Med, Heze 274799, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Dang, Qi] Shandong First Med Univ & Shandong Acad Med Sci, Shandong Canc Hosp & Inst, Phase Clin Trial Ctr 1, Jinan 250012, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Caiqing] Shandong Univ, Shandong Prov Gen Hosp 2, Dept Resp & Crit Care Med, Jinan 250023, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Liu, Hongmei] Shandong First Med Univ, Affiliated Hosp 1, Radiotherapy Dept, Jinan 250014, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Liu, Hongmei; Zhao, Junyan] Shandong Prov Qianfoshan Hosp, Jinan 250014, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Junyan] Shandong First Med Univ, Affiliated Hosp 1, Nursing Dept, Jinan 250014, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Yang, Xiaowei] Tsinghua Univ, Beijing Tsinghua Changgung Hosp, Sch Clin Med, Dept Hepatobiliary Intervent, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Chi] Shandong Univ, Hosp 2, Cheeloo Coll Med, Cardiol Dept, Jinan 250033, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Guo, Liang] Shandong First Med Univ, Affiliated Hosp 3, Peoples Hosp Jinan City 4, Radiotherapy Dept Oncol, Jinan, Peoples R China; [Chen, Feng] Shandong First Med Univ & Shandong Acad Med Sci, Shandong Canc Hosp & Inst, Dept Thorac Surg, Jinan 250117, Peoples R China",Shandong First Medical University & Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences; Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine; Shandong First Medical University & Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences; Shandong University; Shandong First Medical University & Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences; Shandong First Medical University & Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences; Shandong First Medical University & Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences; Tsinghua University; Shandong University; Shandong First Medical University & Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences; Shandong First Medical University & Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences,"Tian, Y (corresponding author), Shandong Univ, Shandong Prov ENT Hosp, Shandong Prov Gen Hosp 2, Somat Radiotherapy Dept, 4 Duanxing Xi Rd, Jinan 250023, Shandong, Peoples R China.",tytytianyuan@aliyun.com,"Tian, Yuan/IAP-8394-2023; Wang, Luyao/JLL-2001-2023; yang, xiaowei/ACQ-1317-2022",,Shandong Medical Association Clinical Research Fund-Qilu Special Project [YXH2022ZX02016]; Medicine and Health Technology Development Plan of Shandong Province [2017WSB04081],Shandong Medical Association Clinical Research Fund-Qilu Special Project; Medicine and Health Technology Development Plan of Shandong Province,"This study was funded by Shandong Medical Association Clinical Research Fund-Qilu Special Project (YXH2022ZX02016, Y.T.), and Medicine and Health Technology Development Plan of Shandong Province (2017WSB04081, H.L.).",,51,0,0,0,1,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",0025-7974,1536-5964,,MEDICINE,Medicine (Baltimore),SEP 9,2022,101,36,,,,,,,e30151,10.1097/MD.0000000000030151,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/MD.0000000000030151,,,11,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),General & Internal Medicine,4K5MH,36086680,"gold, Green Published",,,2024-11-25,WOS:000851993100056,View Full Record in Web of Science

Most of the included trials were considered as low quality. The aggregated results suggested that experimental group with YQHX therapy got better effect in increasing overall response rate (risk ratio, RR = 1.21, 95% confidence interval, CI 1.15-1.27), traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) syndrome response rate (RR = 1.26, 95% CI 1.17-1.36), 6-minute walk test (RR = 2.14, 95% CI 1.05-3.22), left ventricular ejection fraction (RR = 0.97, 95% CI 0.60-1.34), and stroke volume (standardized mean difference, SMD = 0.94, 95% CI 0.23-1.56), and in lowering down the TCM syndrome scores (SMD = -0.78, 95% CI -0.91 to -0.64), Minnesota Living with Heart Failure questionnaire (SMD = -1.01, 95% CI -1.56 to -0.45), 6-month readmission rate (RR = 0.50, 95% CI 0.28-0.89), B-type natriuretic peptide (SMD = -0.89, 95% CI -1.52 to -0.25), NT-proBNP (SMD = -2.07, 95% CI -3.34 to -0.08), and C-reactive protein (SMD = -2.04, 95% CI -4.12 to -0.67) as compared to using conventional Western medicine alone. There were no significant differences found in left ventricular end diastolic diameter and E/E ' between experimental groups and control groups. Moreover, the included sample capacity is small and the trails are all in Chinese. Quality of the evidence for outcomes were low and very low according to the GRADE assessment. Conclusion: YQHX is a valid complementary and alternative therapy in the management of CHF, especially in improving overall response rate, TCM syndrome response rate, 6-minute walk test, left ventricular ejection fraction, and stroke volume and in decreasing TCM syndrome scores, Minnesota Living with Heart Failure questionnaire, 6-month readmission rate, B-type natriuretic peptide, NT-proBNP, and C-reactive protein levels. Hence, YQHX is a relatively effective and safe therapy for CHF patients, which can be popularized and applied in the clinic. More long-term follow-up studies are still needed to substantiate and confirm the current findings.","[Zhang, Miao; Wu, Zheng-Zhi; Jin, Yu] Shenzhen Univ, Affiliated Hosp 1, Shenzhen Peoples Hosp 2, Shenzhen, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Miao; Min, Ma] Jinan Univ, Guangzhou, Peoples R China; [Sun, Ming-Yue; Yin, Hui-Jun; Xu, Feng-Qin] China Acad Chinese Med Sci, Beijing Xiyuan Hosp, Dept Cardiovasc Dis, Bldg Xingyuan,1 Xiyuan Caochang, Beijing 100091, Peoples R China",Shenzhen University; Jinan University; China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences,"Xu, FQ (corresponding author), China Acad Chinese Med Sci, Beijing Xiyuan Hosp, Dept Cardiovasc Dis, Bldg Xingyuan,1 Xiyuan Caochang, Beijing 100091, Peoples R China.",Dr.xufengqin@outlook.com,"Zhang, Miao/J-7136-2017","Zhang, Miao/0000-0002-7546-7129",National Natural Science Foundation of China [82104770]; Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province [2022A1515011456]; National Key R&D Program of China [2017YFC1700301],National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province(National Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province); National Key R&D Program of China,"This work was supported by a grant from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant number: 82104770), Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province (grant number: 2022A1515011456), and grants to FengQin Xu from National Key R&D Program of China (2017YFC1700301).",,46,0,0,1,23,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",0025-7974,1536-5964,,MEDICINE,Medicine (Baltimore),AUG 26,2022,101,34,,,,,,,e30082,10.1097/MD.0000000000030082,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/MD.0000000000030082,,,14,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),General & Internal Medicine,4E0NR,36042620,"Green Published, gold",,,2024-11-25,WOS:000847532100077,View Full Record in Web of Science

Methods: The Arab Journal of Urology (AJU) was searched for SR/MAs published between January 2011 and 31 May 2022. SR/MAs with structured abstract and quantitative synthesis were eligible. Two reviewers simultaneously together selected the SR/MAs by title, screened the abstracts, and included those based on inclusion/exclusion criteria. Data of a range of characteristics were extracted from each SR/MAs into a spreadsheet. To gauge completeness of reporting, the PRISMA-Abstract checklist (12 items) was used to appraise the extent to which abstracts adhered to the checklist. For each abstract, we computed item, section, and overall adherence. Chi-square and t-tests compared the adherence scores. Univariate and multivariate analyses identified the abstract characteristics associated with overall adherence. Results: In total, 66 SR/MAs published during the examined period; 62 were included. Partial reporting was not uncommon. In terms of adherence to the 12 PRISMA-A items were: two items exhibited 100% adherence (title, objectives); five items had 80% to <100% adherence (interpretation, included studies, synthesis of results, eligibility criteria, and information sources); two items displayed 40% to <80% adherence (description of the effect, strengths/limitations of evidence); and three items had adherence that fell between 0% and 1.6% (risk of bias, funding/conflict of interest, registration). Multivariable regression revealed two independent predictors of overall adherence: single-country authorship (i.e. no collaboration) was associated with higher overall adherence (P = 0.046); and abstracts from South America were associated with lower overall adherence (P = 0.04). Conclusion: This study is the first to appraise abstracts of SR/MAs in urology. For high-quality abstracts, improvements are needed in the quality of reporting. Adoption/better adherence to PRISMA-A checklist by editors/authors could improve the reporting quality and completeness of SR/MAs abstracts.","[El Ansari, Walid; Shamsodini, Ahmad; Al Ansari, Abdulla] Hamad Med Corp, Dept Surg, Doha, Qatar; [El Ansari, Walid; AlRumaihi, Khalid; Elbardisi, Haitham] Qatar Univ, Coll Med, Doha, Qatar; [El Ansari, Walid; AlRumaihi, Khalid; Arafa, Mohamed; Elbardisi, Haitham; Majzoub, Ahmad; Shamsodini, Ahmad; Al Ansari, Abdulla] Weill Cornell Med Qatar, Doha, Qatar; [AlRumaihi, Khalid; Arafa, Mohamed; Elbardisi, Haitham; Majzoub, Ahmad; Shamsodini, Ahmad; Al Ansari, Abdulla] Hamad Med Corp, Urol Dept, Doha, Qatar; [El-Ansari, Kareem] Ain Shams Univ, Fac Med, Cairo, Egypt; [Arafa, Mohamed] Cairo Univ, Androl Dept, Cairo, Egypt",Hamad Medical Corporation; Qatar University; Qatar Foundation (QF); Weill Cornell Medical College Qatar; Hamad Medical Corporation; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Ain Shams University; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Cairo University,"El Ansari, W (corresponding author), Hamad Med Corp, Hamad Gen Hosp, Dept Surg, Doha, Qatar.",welansari9@gmail.com,"El-Ansari, Walid/JSL-5914-2023; Majzoub, Ahmad/T-1071-2019; Arafa, Mohamed/I-7829-2019; ElBardisi, Haitham/J-3412-2019","Arafa, Mohamed/0000-0003-0107-8857; ElBardisi, Haitham/0000-0003-3902-7924; El Ansari, Walid/0000-0003-0961-1302",Qatar National Library,Qatar National Library(Qatar National Research Fund (QNRF)),Open Access funding provided by the Qatar National Library.

Two authors independently extracted data and assessed adherence to the 26 items specified by PRISMA-P. For each protocol, we categorized adherence to PRISMA-P as complete (>= 90% of PRISMA-P items were fully reported) or partial (>= 60% of PRISMA-P items were fully reported). We also assessed adherence to each PRISMA-P item across the protocols.Results: Four (8%) of the PubMed-indexed protocols adhered completely and 45 (90%) adhered partially to PRISMA-P but with considerable variation. None (0%) of the PROSPERO-uploaded protocols adhered completely and only 6 (12%) adhered partially to PRISMA-P. For both types of protocols, aspects related to the role of the sponsor, procedures for doing qualitative data synthesis if quantitative synthesis is not appropriate, and methods for assessing publication or outcome reporting biases and confidence in cumulative evidence were often not reported.Conclusion: Adherence to the PRISMA-P reporting guideline was somewhat inadequate in PubMed-indexed protocols and clearly inadequate in PROSPERO-uploaded protocols. Authors of systematic review protocols who decide to report according to PRISMA-P should carefully check all items included in the guideline, and journal editors and peer reviewers should consider PRISMA-P adherence when reviewing protocols for potential publication.

Biodiesel exhibits many advantages over conventional diesel including the possibility of being produced from renewable sources such as waste oils and fats. Specifically, waste animal fats are receiving increased attention as an alternative to vegetable oils for biodiesel production. This low-cost feedstock allows the mitigation of environmental pollution and can also improve biodiesel features by increasing cetane number and enhancing oxidative stability. Among the different technologies available for biodiesel production, supercritical processes offer important advantages over conventional catalytic transesterification in terms of process efficiency and reaction time. According to the increasing interest and number of research articles published in this field in the last years, this work focuses on the systematic review of the technology by using the Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) methodology. This work describes the state of the art of non-catalytic supercritical pro-duction of biodiesel using animal fats as a feedstock and discusses the key aspects of the process such as the type of fat used, operation variables including reaction time, temperature, solvent excess, pressure, and solvent excess, and the final properties of the synthesized biodiesel.(c) 2022 International Energy Initiative.

COSMIN (COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments) has developed a comprehensive and widespread guideline to conduct systematic reviews of outcome measurement instruments, but key information is often missing in published reviews. This hinders the appraisal of the quality of outcome measurement instruments, impacts the decisions of knowledge users regarding their appropriateness, and compromises reproducibility and interpretability of the reviews' findings. To facilitate sufficient, transparent, and consistent reporting of systematic reviews of outcome measurement instruments, an extension of the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting of Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) 2020 guideline will be developed: the PRISMA-COSMIN guideline. Methods: The PRISMA-COSMIN guideline will be developed in accordance with recommendations for reporting guideline development from the EQUATOR (Enhancing the QUAlity and Transparency Of health Research) Network. First, a candidate reporting item list will be created through an environmental literature scan and expert consultations. Second, an international Delphi study will be conducted with systematic review authors, biostatisticians, epidemiologists, psychometricians/clinimetricians, reporting guideline developers, journal editors as well as patients, caregivers, and members of the public. Delphi panelists will rate candidate items for inclusion on a 5-point scale, suggest additional candidate items, and give feedback on item wording and comprehensibility. Third, the draft PRISMA-COSMIN guideline and user manual will be iteratively piloted by applying it to systematic reviews in several disease areas to assess its relevance, comprehensiveness, and comprehensibility, along with usability and user satisfaction. Fourth, a consensus meeting will be held to finalize the PRISMA-COSMIN guideline through round-table discussions and voting. Last, a user manual will be developed and the final PRISMA-COSMIN guideline will be disseminated through publications, conferences, newsletters, and relevant websites. Additionally, relevant journals and organizations will be invited to endorse and implement PRISMA-COSMIN. Throughout the project, evaluations will take place to identify barriers and facilitators of involving patient/public partners and employing a virtual process. Discussion: The PRISMA-COSMIN guideline will ensure that the reports of systematic reviews of outcome measurement instruments are complete and informative, enhancing their reproducibility, ease of use, and uptake.","[Elsman, Ellen B.

Materials and Methods: Twenty-four articles (systematic review and meta-analysis, n = 18; systematic review only, n = 6) published between August 2009 and September 2021 in the Korean Journal of Radiology were analyzed. Completeness of the reporting of main texts and abstracts were evaluated using the PRISMA 2020 statement. For each item in the statement, the proportion of studies that met the guidelines' recommendation was calculated and items that were satisfied by fewer than 80% of the studies were identified. The review process was conducted by two independent reviewers. Results: Of the 42 items (including sub-items) in the PRISMA 2020 statement for main text, 24 were satisfied by fewer than 80% of the included articles. The 24 items were grouped into eight domains: 1) assessment of the eligibility of potential articles, 2) assessment of the risk of bias, 3) synthesis of results, 4) additional analysis of study heterogeneity, 5) assessment of non-reporting bias, 6) assessment of the certainty of evidence, 7) provision of limitations of the study, and 8) additional information, such as protocol registration. Of the 12 items in the abstract checklists, eight were incorporated in fewer than 80% of the included publications. Conclusion: Several items included in the PRISMA 2020 checklist were overlooked in systematic review and meta-analysis articles published in the Korean Journal of Radiology. Based on these results, we suggest a double-check list for improving the quality of systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Authors and reviewers should familiarize themselves with the PRISMA 2020 statement and check whether the recommended items are fully satisfied prior to publication.","[Park, Ho Young; Suh, Chong Hyun; Kim, Pyeong Hwa; Kim, Kyung Won] Univ Ulsan, Asan Med Ctr, Dept Radiol, Coll Med, 88 Olymp Ro 43 Gil, Seoul 05505, South Korea; [Park, Ho Young; Suh, Chong Hyun; Kim, Pyeong Hwa; Kim, Kyung Won] Univ Ulsan, Asan Med Ctr, Res Inst Radiol, Coll Med, 88 Olymp Ro 43 Gil, Seoul 05505, South Korea; [Woo, Sungmin] Mem Sloan Kettering Canc Ctr, Dept Radiol, 1275 York Ave, New York, NY 10021 USA",University of Ulsan; University of Ulsan; Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center,"Suh, CH (corresponding author), Univ Ulsan, Asan Med Ctr, Dept Radiol, Coll Med, 88 Olymp Ro 43 Gil, Seoul 05505, South Korea.;Suh, CH (corresponding author), Univ Ulsan, Asan Med Ctr, Res Inst Radiol, Coll Med, 88 Olymp Ro 43 Gil, Seoul 05505, South Korea.",chonghyunsuh@amc.seoul.kr,"Kim, Pyeong Hwa/KGM-1468-2024; KIM, KYUN/Q-3070-2018; Woo, Sungmin/L-2100-2019","Woo, Sungmin/0000-0001-8459-8369; Kim, Kyung Won/0000-0002-1532-5970; PARK, HO YOUNG/0000-0003-2318-9806","Korea Health Technology R&D Project through the Korea Health Industry Development Institute (KHIDI) - Ministry of Health & Welfare, Republic of Korea [HI18C2383]","Korea Health Technology R&D Project through the Korea Health Industry Development Institute (KHIDI) - Ministry of Health & Welfare, Republic of Korea","This research was supported by a grant of the Korea Health Technology R&D Project through the Korea Health Industry Development Institute (KHIDI), funded by the Ministry of Health & Welfare, Republic of Korea (grant number: HI18C2383).",,58,21,21,7,32,KOREAN SOCIETY OF RADIOLOGY,SEOUL,"71, YANGJAECHEON-RO, SEOCHO-GU, SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA",1229-6929,2005-8330,,KOREAN J RADIOL,Korean J.

The researchers contributed a lot to spreading knowledge about IPv6 vulnerabilities and how to address them over the past two decades. In this study, a systematic literature review is conducted to analyze research progress in IPv6 security field following the Preferred Reporting Items for the Systematics Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) method. A total of 427 studies have been reviewed from two databases, IEEE and Scopus. To fulfil the review goal, several key data elements were extracted from each study and two kinds of analysis were administered: descriptive analysis and literature classification. The results show positive signs of the research contributions in the field, and generally, they could be considered as a reference to explore the research of in the past two decades in IPv6 security field and to draw the future directions. For example, the percentage of publishing increased from 147 per decade from 2000-2010 to 330 per decade from 2011 to 2020 which means that the percentage increase was 124%. The number of citations is another key finding that reflects the great global interest in research devoted to IPv6 security issues, as it was 409 citations in the decade from 20002010, then increased to 1643 citations during the decade from 2011 to 2020, that is, the percentage increase was 302%.","[Abdullah, Shubair A.] Sultan Qaboos Univ, Muscat, Oman; [Al Ashoor, Ahmed A.] Univ Basrah, Basrah, Iraq",Sultan Qaboos University; University of Basrah,"Abdullah, SA (corresponding author), Sultan Qaboos Univ, Muscat, Oman.",shubair@squ.edu.om; ahmed.ashur@uobasrah.edu.iq,"Alashoor, Ahmed/F-7497-2019",,,,,,71,3,3,2,15,"COLL SCIENCE WOMEN, UNIV BAGHDAD",BAGHDAD,"PO BOX 4732, AL- JADIRYA, BAGHDAD, 00000, IRAQ",2078-8665,2411-7986,,BAGHDAD SCI J,Baghdad Sci.

The questions guiding the research are: what are the emerging technologies used by local governments? And what are the challenges and consequences of using emerging technologies in local governments? The findings show three types of emerging technologies: 1) Basic (such as mobile technology, Web 2.0, websites and ICT), 2) Cutting edge (such as Blockchain, artificial intelligence, Big Data, and Internet of things) and 3) Specific and applied to smart cities, urban agriculture, environmental awareness, and telehealth. Although the implementation of emerging technologies can result in benefits for the public sector, one of the challenges lies in bridging the gap between technology developers and decision makers. Also, the inscrutable status of some algorithms and the mass surveillance capabilities of some emerging technologies threaten the freedom of societies and may dehumanize some processes in the public sector.","[Valle-Cruz, David] Univ Autonoma Estado Mex, Ciencias Econ Adm, Toluca, Spain; [Gil-Garcia, Jose Ramon] Univ Estatal Nueva York Albany, Adm & Politicas Publicas, Albany, NY USA; [Gil-Garcia, Jose Ramon] Univ Estatal Nueva York Albany, Rockefeller Coll Publ Affairs & Policy, Albany, NY USA; [Gil-Garcia, Jose Ramon] Univ Las Americas Puebla, Puebla, Mexico",Universidad Americas Puebla (UDLAP),"Valle-Cruz, D (corresponding author), Univ Autonoma Estado Mex, Ciencias Econ Adm, Toluca, Spain.",davacr@uaemex.mx; jgil-garcia@albany.edu,"Valle-Cruz, David/AAF-7198-2020; Gil-Garcia, J./A-9636-2009",,,,,,56,1,1,11,51,UNIV GUANAJUATO,GUANAJUATO,"LASCURAIN RETANA 5, CENTRO, GUANAJUATO, 36000, MEXICO",2007-4425,2007-4638,,REV MEX ANAL POLITIC,Rev.

This article presents a new 3-D power electronic design methodology based on the concept of mutual inductance cancellation and multisided heat transfer. New 3-D prismatic packaging concepts are proposed for wide band gap power devices, where the devices can be mounted at acute angles to adjacent interconnects or other devices. Discussion is given on electrical and thermal path optimization in a 3-D space. To validate the 3-D prismatic packaging methodology, a 1200 V/50 A SiC half-bridge power module is fabricated and tested for electrical and thermal performance and results are compared with simulations. The power density calculated for the module is 12 kW/in(3) (including heatsink) and shows a 31.3% inductance reduction compared to a 2-D planar module. Finally, design guidance suggested for utilizing prismatic structures is provided, together with suggested future work in the area.

The inclusion criteria were (i) publication date between 2000 and 2018, (ii) being an empirical study, (iii) written in English and Turkish languages (the two languages spoken by the authors), (iv) published in a scholarly peer-reviewed journal, and (v) conducted an assessment of IGD and personality traits objectively. Studies were excluded from the review if they were (i) single-case studies, (ii) unpublished thesis and dissertation studies, and (iii) not published in a peer-reviewed journal. Following these procedures, 21 eligible empirical studies were included. Results demonstrated that 24 distinct personality traits had been examined in relation to IGD and that some of these traits were demonstrated as risk factors for gaming addiction (although not always in the same direction).","[Salvarli, Serife Inci] Dokuz Eylul Univ, Fac Letters, Psychol Dept, Dogus St, TR-35390 Izmir, Turkey; [Griffiths, Mark D.] Nottingham Trent Univ, Psychol Dept, Int Gaming Res Unit, 50 Shakespeare St, Nottingham NG1 4FQ, England",Dokuz Eylul University; Nottingham Trent University,"Griffiths, MD (corresponding author), Nottingham Trent Univ, Psychol Dept, Int Gaming Res Unit, 50 Shakespeare St, Nottingham NG1 4FQ, England.",inci.salvarli@deu.edu.tr; mark.griffiths@ntu.ac.uk,"şalvarlı, şerife inci/AHC-8529-2022","salvarli, serife inci/0000-0001-9248-5292; Griffiths, Mark/0000-0001-8880-6524",,,,,71,62,65,8,102,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1557-1874,1557-1882,,INT J MENT HEALTH AD,Int.

We tabulated percentages and frequencies of (a) publications in ten-year periods, (b) type of publications, (c) sampling by geographical location, (d) methodologies used, (e) the top tenth percentile of the most highly cited research, and (f) topics covered. Our analyses reveal that particularly strong growth occurred in the literature between 2000 and 2020. In the literature we retrieved, the most commonly sampled research participants were those in the United States, followed by the United Kingdom and Australia. Quantitative research designs were most prevalent, accounting for two-thirds of all studies reviewed (66.2%), with questionnaires and recordings being the most common methods of data collection. Non-empirical papers (17.5%) as well as studies incorporating qualitative (13.5%) and mixed-methods designs (3.1%) were much less prevalent. Ericsson et al.'s (1993) seminal study of deliberate practice, Driskell et al.'s (1994) review of the research literature on mental practice, and Sloboda et al.'s (1996) study of young musicians were by far the most often cited. Overall, the most common topics addressed were deliberate practice, practice strategies, mental practice, the benefits of practice, metacognition, self-regulation, and self-efficacy, suggesting that music practice is a rich, multifaceted, and complex activity. In light of the findings, recommendations for practice and implications for future research are provided.","[How, Ee Ran; Tan, Leonard] Nanyang Technol Univ, Natl Inst Educ, 1 Nanyang Walk, Singapore 637616, Singapore; [Miksza, Peter] Indiana Univ, Jacobs Sch Mus, Bloomington, IN USA",Nanyang Technological University; National Institute of Education (NIE) Singapore; Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"How, ER (corresponding author), Nanyang Technol Univ, Natl Inst Educ, 1 Nanyang Walk, Singapore 637616, Singapore.",nie19.her@e.ntu.edu.sg,"Tan, Leonard/AAE-9800-2019","Miksza, Peter/0000-0002-7365-9207; How, Ee Ran/0000-0003-2560-4882",,,,,141,13,13,6,48,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,LONDON,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",1029-8649,2045-4147,,MUSIC SCI,Music Sci.,SEP,2022,26,3,,,,,675,697,1.02986E+16,10.1177/10298649211005531,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/10298649211005531,,APR 2021,23,"Music; Psychology, Experimental",Social Science Citation Index (SSCI); Arts & Humanities Citation Index (A&HCI),Music; Psychology,4I0DU,,,,,2024-11-25,WOS:000643484900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

We invited 220 systematic review methodologists and journal editors to complete a survey about the suggested modifications. The results of these projects were discussed at a 21-member in-person meeting. Following the meeting, we drafted the PRISMA 2020 statement and refined it based on feedback from co-authors and a convenience sample of 15 systematic reviewers.& nbsp; Results: The review of 60 documents revealed that all topics addressed by the PRISMA 2009 statement could be modified. Of the 110 survey respondents, more than 66% recommended keeping six of the original checklist items as they were and modifying 15 of them using wording suggested by us. Attendees at the in-person meeting supported the revised wording for several items but suggested rewording for most to enhance clarity, and further refinements were made over six drafts of the guideline.& nbsp; Conclusions: The PRISMA 2020 statement consists of updated reporting guidance for systematic reviews. We hope that providing this detailed description of the development process will enhance the acceptance and uptake of the guideline and assist those developing and updating future reporting guidelines.

Methods A systematic search of the literature was conducted in the PubMed and Scopus databases in March 2020. The search focused on the SRs of evaluations of interventions published since 2002 in the field of periodontology. The abstracts of the selected SRs were divided into two groups before and after publication of the PRISMA-A checklist in 2013, and compliance with the 12 items reported in the checklist was evaluated by three calibrated evaluators. Results A set of 265 abstracts was included in the study. The total score before (mean score, 53.78%; 95% CI, 51.56-55.90%) and after (mean score, 56.88%; 95% CI, 55.39-58.44%) the publication of the PRISMA-A statement exhibited a statistically significant improvement (P = 0.012*). Nevertheless, only the checklist items included studies and synthesis of the results displayed a statistically significant change after guideline publication. The total PRISMA-A score was higher in the meta-analysis group and in articles authored by more than four authors. Conclusions The impact of the PRISMA-A was statistically significant, but the majority of the items did not improve after its introduction. The editors and referees of periodontal journals should promote adherence to the checklist to improve the quality of the reports and provide readers with better insight into the characteristics of published studies.","[Adobes Martin, Milagros; Llario Alminana, Inmaculada; Garcovich, Daniele] Univ Europea Valencia, Dept Dent, Paseo Alameda 7, Valencia 46010, Spain; [Adobes Martin, Milagros] Univ Valencia, Dept Dent, Valencia, Spain; [Santamans Faustino, Sala] Univ Catolica Valencia, Dept Dent, Valencia, Spain; [Aiuto, Riccardo] Univ Milan, Dept Oral Rehabil, Ist Stomatol Italiano, Milan, Italy; [Rotundo, Roberto] UCL, Eastman Dent Inst, Periodontol Unit, London, England",University of Valencia; Universidad Catolica de Valencia San Vicente Martir; University of Milan; University of London; University College London,"Garcovich, D (corresponding author), Univ Europea Valencia, Dept Dent, Paseo Alameda 7, Valencia 46010, Spain.",daniele.garcovich@universidadeuropea.es,"garcovich, daniele/AAQ-5079-2021; Aiuto, Riccardo/AHD-2430-2022","Aiuto, Riccardo/0000-0001-8116-9614; Adobes Martin, Milagros/0000-0002-9155-3844; Garcovich, Daniele/0000-0001-8516-8352; Rotundo, Roberto/0000-0001-9090-0624",,,,,26,4,4,1,3,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,1471-2288,,BMC MED RES METHODOL,BMC Med.

The accurate estimation of crop water requirement is of critical importance to minimize over and under irrigation problems. Several empirical/semi empirical equations have been developed in the past to quantify ETo. The Penmen-Montieth equation (FAO-PM56) has been globally accepted for estimation of ETo but certain limitations were found to its implementation. The use of soft computing models in estimation of ETo has received enormous interest in recent decade. Many studies have been reported in the literature to apply soft computing models on the improvement of ETo estimation. This study intended to review these studies on basis of accuracy, structure and its flexibility/usefulness, and also made some possible suggestions for future research in this domain.","[Raza, Ali; Hu, Yongguang] Jiangsu Univ, Sch Agr Equipment Engn, Zhenjiang 212013, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Shoaib, Muhammad] Bahauddin Zakariya Univ, Dept Agr Engn, Multan, Pakistan; [Abd Elnabi, Manar K.] Tanta Univ, Dept Bot, Fac Sci, Tanta 31527, Egypt; [Zubair, Muhammad] Southeast Univ, Sch Transportat, Nanjing 21009, Peoples R China; [Nauman, Muhammad] Jiangsu Univ, Sch Energy & Power Engn, Zhenjiang 212013, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Syed, Neyha Rubab] Int Islam Univ, Dept Environm Sci, Islamabad, Pakistan","Jiangsu University; Bahauddin Zakariya University; Egyptian Knowledge Bank (EKB); Tanta University; Southeast University - China; Jiangsu University; International Islamic University, Pakistan","Hu, YH (corresponding author), Jiangsu Univ, Sch Agr Equipment Engn, Zhenjiang 212013, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",deerhu@ujs.edu.cn,"Zubair, Muhammad/ABI-6695-2020; Raza, Ali/GLR-6548-2022; Nauman, Muhammad/HMV-9061-2023","Nauman, Muhammad/0000-0002-9504-5855",,,,,55,9,9,0,38,HARD,OLSZTYN 5,"POST-OFFICE BOX, 10-718 OLSZTYN 5, POLAND",1230-1485,2083-5906,,POL J ENVIRON STUD,Pol.

In this regard, the thermophysical properties of the batteries are key parameters for developing reliable and accurate thermal models. This study presents a new, simple, and cost-effective method for determination of heat capacity and anisotropic thermal conductivity of a commercial high energy density (43 Ah) prismatic-shape lithium-ion battery. The influence of various operating temperatures on thermal parameters is investigated. The predicted heat capacity and thermal conductivity are then used to simulate the battery cell temperature at a high current charge and discharge rate using a lumped thermal network and a three-dimensional (3D) thermal model at different environment temperatures. Additionally, the thermal behavior of a 48 V battery module consisting of 12 cells is simulated using a 3D thermal model at room temperature. Both cell and module level simulations are validated with experimental results obtained by thermocouples and a thermal camera. The thermal characterization results reveal that the heat capacity of the battery slightly increases as the operating temperature increases, while the thermal conductivity remains independent of the temperature. The comparison of simulation and experimental results indicate that the developed method in this study is a quick and practical way to accurately predict the thermophysical properties of the battery and contribute towards the thermal management of Li-ion modules and packs.","[Akbarzadeh, Mohsen; Kalogiannis, Theodoros; Jaguemont, Joris; He, Jiacheng; Berecibar, Maitane; Van Mierlo, Joeri] Vrije Univ Brussel VUB, ETEC Dept, Pl Laan 2, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Akbarzadeh, Mohsen; Kalogiannis, Theodoros; Jaguemont, Joris; He, Jiacheng; Berecibar, Maitane; Van Mierlo, Joeri] Vrije Univ Brussel VUB, MOBI Res Grp, Pl Laan 2, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium; [Akbarzadeh, Mohsen; Kalogiannis, Theodoros; Jaguemont, Joris; He, Jiacheng; Berecibar, Maitane; Van Mierlo, Joeri] Flanders Make, B-3001 Heverlee, Belgium; [Jin, Lu] Global Energy Interconnect Res Inst Europe GmbH, D-10623 Berlin, Germany",Vrije Universiteit Brussel; Vrije Universiteit Brussel,"Akbarzadeh, M (corresponding author), Vrije Univ Brussel VUB, ETEC Dept, Pl Laan 2, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.;Akbarzadeh, M (corresponding author), Vrije Univ Brussel VUB, MOBI Res Grp, Pl Laan 2, B-1050 Brussels, Belgium.;Akbarzadeh, M (corresponding author), Flanders Make, B-3001 Heverlee, Belgium.",Mohsen.Akbarzadeh.Sokkeh@vub.be,"Berecibar, Maitane/AAP-1851-2020; Van Mierlo, Joeri/JOZ-0872-2023","Berecibar, Maitane/0000-0002-9567-9866; Akbarzadeh Sokkeh, Mohsen/0000-0001-7464-9425; HE, Jiacheng/0000-0002-4582-1019",Flanders Make,Flanders Make,"This research has been made possible, thanks to the research project GEIRI.

Whole-core, three-dimensional temperature profiles are computed at an individual fuel pin and lattice assembly block levels. A method that computes the fluid mass, velocity (momentum), and energy throughout a transient is implemented using a well-documented, semi-implicit pressure-correction scheme. Models for reactor cavity cooling system (RCCS) heat transfer and decay heat generation are also included. Pressurized (P-LOFC) and de-pressurized (D-LOFC) accidents are simulated. This method provides two significant advantages over available thermalhydraulic analysis techniques. The first is its ability to compute whole-core results and capture the important transient core-level phenomena such as bypass flow and heat redistribution into the reflector assemblies after reactor SCRAM. The second is its ability to compute each fuel assembly in detail, computing the heat rates and temperature profiles for every fuel pin, graphite, and coolant channel. These features produce realistic, 3-D transient results for prismatic HTGRs during a LOFC. A RELAP model is also developed and implemented for the HTGR. The limitations of existing methods for the simulation of the prismatic fuel are identified and the need for and novelty of the present method are highlighted.","[Huning, Alexander; Chandrasekaran, Sriram; Garimella, Srinivas] Georgia Inst Technol, George W Woodruff Sch Mech Engn, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA",University System of Georgia; Georgia Institute of Technology,"Garimella, S (corresponding author), Georgia Inst Technol, GWW Sch Mech Engn, Love Bldg,Room 340,801 Ferst Dr, Atlanta, GA 30332 USA.",sgarimella@gatech.edu,"Garimella, Srinivas/E-1859-2013","Huning, Alexander/0000-0003-1494-7601; Garimella, Srinivas/0000-0002-5697-4096","US Department of Energy, Office of Nuclear Energy's Nuclear Energy University Program [DE-AC07-05ID14517, 09-396]","US Department of Energy, Office of Nuclear Energy's Nuclear Energy University Program(United States Department of Energy (DOE))","This research was funded by the US Department of Energy, Office of Nuclear Energy's Nuclear Energy University Program award DE-AC07-05ID14517 (project number 09-396).",,12,1,1,0,6,ELSEVIER SCIENCE SA,LAUSANNE,"PO BOX 564, 1001 LAUSANNE, SWITZERLAND",0029-5493,1872-759X,,NUCL ENG DES,Nucl.

Methods: PubMed was searched for abstracts published during 2010-2012 (Pre-PRISMA period) and 2017-2019 (Post-PRISMA period). Reporting quality was assessed and scored using a modified 13-item PRSIMA-A checklist. Risk ratio (RR) was used to compare the adequate reporting rate of each item between the two periods. Uni-variable and multivariable linear regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated with reporting quality. Results: A total of 160 abstracts were included and assessed. Only four items ('objective', 'results of main outcomes', 'description of the effect' and 'interpretation') were adequately reported in most abstracts (>75 %). According to the multivariable analysis, greater word count (P = 0.001), being published in the Post-PRISMA period (P = 0.025) and geographic origin from Asia (P = 0.025) or South America (P = 0.015) were significantly associated with higher reporting quality. Conclusions/clinical significance: The reporting quality of SR abstracts in operative dentistry had improved significantly after the publication of PRISMA-A, but was still suboptimal. Researchers, reviewers and journal editors in operative dentistry need to be familiar with the PRISMA-A checklist, and make concerted efforts to improve the reporting of SR abstracts.","[Li, Ting; Dan, Shiqi; Zhong, Yuxin; Song, Yaling] Wuhan Univ, Sch & Hosp Stomatol, Hubei MOST KLOS & KLOBM, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Li, Ting; Song, Yaling] Wuhan Univ, Sch & Hosp Stomatol, Dept Geriatr Dent, Luoyu Rd 237, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China; [Hua, Fang] Wuhan Univ, Sch & Hosp Stomatol, Ctr Evidence Based Stomatol, Wuhan, Peoples R China; [Hua, Fang] Univ Manchester, Manchester Acad Hlth Sci Ctr, Fac Biol Med & Hlth, Sch Med Sci,Div Dent, Manchester, Lancs, England; [Levey, Colin] Univ Dundee, Sch Dent, Dundee, Scotland",Wuhan University; Wuhan University; Wuhan University; University of Manchester; University of Dundee,"Song, YL (corresponding author), Wuhan Univ, Sch & Hosp Stomatol, Dept Geriatr Dent, Luoyu Rd 237, Wuhan 430079, Peoples R China.",sningya@whu.edu.cn,"Hua, Fang/G-6344-2013","Hua, Fang/0000-0002-2438-5924; Levey, Colin/0000-0003-1685-7810; Li, Ting/0000-0003-0443-356X; Song, Yaling/0000-0003-0747-7381",China Postdoctoral Science Foundation [2018M630884]; Wuhan Young and Middle-aged Medical Talents Training Program [[2019]87]; National Natural Science Foundation of China [81670976],China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(China Postdoctoral Science Foundation); Wuhan Young and Middle-aged Medical Talents Training Program; National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)),"This study was supported by the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (No. 2018M630884), and the Wuhan Young and Middle-aged Medical Talents Training Program (No. [2019]87), and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 81670976).",,49,16,17,0,14,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",0300-5712,1879-176X,,J DENT,J.

Moxibustion is a representative external treatment in traditional Chinese medicine that has been beneficial to DPN. We aim to systematically assess the efficacy and safety of moxibustion in treating DPN, following PRISMA guidelines. Methods: Eight electronic databases were searched to acquire information on eligible trials published from inception to June 1, 2019. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) applying moxibustion therapy with a minimum of 14-days treatment duration for DPN patients compared with placebo, no intervention, or conventional WM interventions. The primary outcomes in our study include the sensory-nerve conduction velocity (SNCV) and motor-nerve conduction velocity (MNCV). We used the Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias tool to assess the methodological quality of eligible RCTs. Statistical analyses were conducted using Review Manager 5.3. Risk ratios (RR) and mean differences (MD) were calculated with a 95% confidence interval (CI). The chi(2)test was applied to assess the heterogeneity. Results: In total, 11 RCTs were included that involved 927 DPN patients. Compared with the control group, there was an increase in median MNCV (MD = 6.26, 95% CI 2.64-9.89, Z = 3.39,P = .0007) and peroneal MNCV (MD = 6.45, 95% CI 5.30-7.61,P < .00001). There was also an increase in median SNCV (MD = 6.64, 95% CI 3.25-10.03,P = .0001) and peroneal SNCV (MD = 3. 57, 95% CI 2.06-5.09, Z = 4.63,P < .00001) in the treatment groups. The treatment groups receiving moxibustion therapy indicated a more significant improvement in total effectiveness rate (RR = 0.25, 95% CI 0.18-0.37, Z = 7.16,P < .00001). Toronto Clinical Scoring System indicated a significant decrease in the treatment groups (MD = -2.12, 95% CI -2.82 to 1.43,P < .00001). Only 1 study reported that treatment groups experienced no adverse reactions. The other 10 studies did not mention adverse events. Conclusions: Moxibustion therapy may be an effective and safe option for DPN patients but needs to be verified in further rigorous studies.","[Tan, Yumeng; Pang, Bing; Du, Lijuan; Yang, Yanan; Pang, Qing; Zhang, Meizhen; Wu, Qian; Zhang, Yi; Ni, Qing] China Acad Chinese Med Sci, Guangan Men Hosp, Dept Endocrinol, 5 Beixiange, Beijing 100053, Peoples R China; [Hu, Jun] China Acad Chinese Med Sci, Guangan Men Hosp, Dept Cardiovasc, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Wu, Qian; Zhang, Yi] Beijing Univ Chinese Med, Beijing, Peoples R China",China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences; China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences; Beijing University of Chinese Medicine,"Ni, Q (corresponding author), China Acad Chinese Med Sci, Guangan Men Hosp, Dept Endocrinol, 5 Beixiange, Beijing 100053, Peoples R China.",niqing669@163.com,,,capital health research and development of special [2016-1-4151]; Beijing Natural Science Foundation [7182143],capital health research and development of special; Beijing Natural Science Foundation(Beijing Natural Science Foundation),"This study was supported by the capital health research and development of special (no: 2016-1-4151), Beijing Natural Science Foundation (no: 7182143).",,30,4,6,1,5,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",0025-7974,1536-5964,,MEDICINE,Medicine (Baltimore),SEP 25,2020,99,39,,,,,,,e22286,10.1097/MD.0000000000022286,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/MD.0000000000022286,,,11,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),General & Internal Medicine,OC8ZT,32991431,"Green Published, gold",,,2024-11-25,WOS:000579445400033,View Full Record in Web of Science

Whether the risk of CACL tear is related to graft selection remains controversial due to contradictory results in studies. There are no meta-analyses to compare which graft has a higher CACL injury rate. Hence, this meta-analysis was conducted to compare the incidence of the CACL injury after ACL reconstruction with bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB) autografts compared with hamstring (HT) autografts. Methods: A comprehensive search of literature published between 1980 and January 2020 was performed using MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library databases. RevMan 5.3 software was used for meta-analysis. The overall risk ratio (RR) was calculated using a fixed- or random-effects. The heterogeneity among the included results was analyzed by chi-square test with significance set atP < .10, and the heterogeneity was quantitatively detected by I-square tests. Results: Fifteen prospective comparative studies met inclusion criteria. In the BPTB group, the CACL rupture rate ranged from 1.8% to 30%, with a pooled percentage of 8.5%. In the HT group, the CACL rupture rate ranged from 0% to 14.4%, with a pooled percentage of 3.3%. The overall CACL rupture rate was 3.1% and ranged from 1.1% to 27.1%, with a pooled percentage of 4.9%. The pooled results indicate that there was a statistical significant difference in CACL rupture risk rate between BPTB and HT autograft. (RR, 1.53; 95% CL, 1.21-1.91;P = .0004). Conclusion: This review showed that patients undergoing primary ACL reconstruction with BPTB autograft were more likely to have CACL rupture than patients treated with HT autograft.","[Zhou, Peng; Liu, Jun-Cai; Deng, Xiang-Tian; Li, Zhong] Southwest Med Univ, Dept Orthopaed, Affiliated Hosp, Luzhou 646000, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Deng, Xiang-Tian] Nankai Univ, Sch Med, Tianjin, Peoples R China",Southwest Medical University; Nankai University,"Li, Z (corresponding author), Southwest Med Univ, Dept Orthopaed, Affiliated Hosp, Luzhou 646000, Sichuan, Peoples R China.",545890312@qq.com,,,Sichuan university [2019cdlz-17]; Luzhou municipal people's government [2019cdlz-17],Sichuan university(Sichuan University); Luzhou municipal people's government,This research is supported by Cooperation program between Sichuan university and Luzhou municipal people's government (No. 2019cdlz-17).,,49,4,5,0,10,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",0025-7974,1536-5964,,MEDICINE,Medicine (Baltimore),JUL 31,2020,99,31,,,,,,,e21540,10.1097/MD.0000000000021540,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/MD.0000000000021540,,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),General & Internal Medicine,NE6EZ,32756207,"gold, Green Published",,,2024-11-25,WOS:000562693800137,View Full Record in Web of Science

That is why it lends itself to the application of system dynamics modelling. In last five years a relatively high level of experience and knowledge has accumulated related to the application of computer-aided system modelling for the analysis and forecasting of the bioethanol sector. The goal of the current paper is to offer a systematic review of the application of system dynamics models in order to better understand the structure, conduct and performance of the bioethanol sector. Our method has been the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA), based on English-language materials published between 2015 and 2020. The results highlight that system dynamic models have become more and more complex, but as a consequence of the improvement in information technology and statistical systems, as well as the increasing experience gained they offer an efficient tool for decision makers in the business and political spheres. In the future, the combination of traditional system dynamics modelling and agent-based models will offer new perspectives for the preparation of more sophisticated description and forecasting.","[Olah, Judit] Univ Debrecen, Fac Econ & Business, H-4032 Debrecen, Hungary; [Olah, Judit; Popp, Jozsef] North West Univ, TRADE Res Ent, ZA-1900 Vanderbijlpark, South Africa; [Krisan, Eszter; Popp, Jozsef] Szent Istvan Univ, Fac Econ & Social Sci, H-2100 Godollo, Hungary; [Kiss, Anna] Szent Istvan Univ, Fac Food Sci, H-1118 Budapest, Hungary; [Lakner, Zoltan] Szent Istvan Univ, Fac Food Sci, Dept Food Econ, H-2100 Godollo, Hungary",University of Debrecen; North West University - South Africa; Hungarian University of Agriculture & Life Sciences; Hungarian University of Agriculture & Life Sciences; Hungarian University of Agriculture & Life Sciences,"Lakner, Z (corresponding author), Szent Istvan Univ, Fac Food Sci, Dept Food Econ, H-2100 Godollo, Hungary.",olah.judit@econ.unideb.hu; krisan.eszter@gmail.com; kiss.anna891@gmail.com; lakner.zoltan@etk.szie.hu; popp.jozsef@gtk.szie.hu,"Oláh, Prof. Dr./U-5352-2019; Popp, József/AFN-1250-2022; Kiss, Anna/KYQ-3643-2024","Popp, Jozsef/0000-0003-0848-4591","National Research, Development, and Innovation Fund of Hungary under the K_19 funding scheme [132805]; Janos Bolyai Research Scholarship of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences; [EFOP-3.6.3-VEKOP-16-2017-00005]","National Research, Development, and Innovation Fund of Hungary under the K_19 funding scheme; Janos Bolyai Research Scholarship of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences(Hungarian Academy of Sciences);","Project no. 132805 has been implemented with support provided from the National Research, Development, and Innovation Fund of Hungary, financed under the K_19 funding scheme and supported by the Janos Bolyai Research Scholarship of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences.

Methods Electronic search performed in August 2018 to retrieve meta-analyses published from April 2014 to May 2018. PRISMA evaluation was determined by total scores of individual meta-analyses and items scores. Statistical analysis of parameters affecting the reporting evaluation included subgroup multivariate analysis and regression analysis. Results Twelve meta-analyses were finally included, three being Cochrane systematic reviews. Mean PRISMA score is 23.2/27 (86.1%). Eleven PRISMA ITEMS had significantly higher %score in 12 meta-analyses than in nine non-Cochrane meta-analyses measurements. Positive strong correlation identified between PRISMA %score and journal impact factor (JIF). Multivariate analysis between high-scored and low-scored meta-analyses established difference in means of several parameters (JIF, Publication Year). Conclusions The evaluation of overall reporting quality was favorable. As expected, the key role of several characteristics of meta-analysis affects this quality.

Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) combined with chemotherapy drugs interventions have been applied for the treatment of malignant tumors in Asian countries for dacades. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness and safety on the combination of Kanglaite injection and fluorouracil-based chemotherapy for treating digestive tract malignancies. Purpose: To assess the effectiveness and safety on the combination of Kanglaite injection and fluorouracil-based chemotherapy for digestive tract malignancies. Methods: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed when conducting the meta-analysis. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of Kanglaite injection combined with fluorouracil-based chemotherapy in the treatment of digestive tract malignant tumors were selected and assessed for inclusion. RevMan 5.3 software (Cochrane Collaboration, Oxford, UK) was used for meta-analysis. The objective response rate (ORR) was defined as the primary endpoint, and the disease control rate (DCR), quality of life (QoL), and toxicities were the secondary outcomes. Results: 20 RCTs enrolling 1339 patients with advanced digestive tract malignancies were included. The methodological quality of most included trials was low to moderate. Compared with fluorouracil-based chemotherapy alone, Kanglaite injection plus fluorouracil-based chemotherapy can improve DCR (risk ratio (RR) = 1.18, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.11-1.25,P < .00001), ORR (RR = 1.35, 95% CI 1.18-1.54,P < .00001), QoL (RR = 1.58, 95% CI 1.35-1.85,P < .00001), and can reduce adverse drug reactions (ADRs) such as myelosuppression (RR = 0.33, 95% CI 0.25-0.43,P < .00001), leukopenia (RR = 0.31, 95% CI 0.22-0.43,P < .00001), thrombocytopenia (RR = 0.6, 95% CI 0.38-0.49,P = .03), neutropenia (RR = 0.26, 95% CI 0.12-0.55,P = .0005), anemia (RR = 0.41, 95% CI 0.23-0.75,P = .004), gastrointestinal reaction (RR = 0.35, 95% CI 0.27-0.46,P < .00001), nausea/vomiting (RR = 0.41, 95% CI 0.28-0.61,P < .00001), diarrhea (RR = 0.34, 95% CI 0.18-0.62,P = .0004), hepatotoxicity (RR = 0.28, 95% CI 0.17-0.47,P < .00001), neurotoxicity (RR = 0.58, 95% CI 0.41-0.82,P = .002), mucositis (RR = 0.59, 95% CI 0.29-1.21,P = .15). Conclusion: Kanglaite injection combined with fluorouracil-based chemotherapy could remarkably improve the clinical effectiveness and reduce the adverse effects in patients with advanced malignant tumors of the digestive tract which may provide evidence to judge whether TCM is an effective and safe intervention for the digestive tract malignancies.","[Song, Qi; Zhang, Jie; Wu, Qibiao; Li, Guoping; Leung, Elaine Lai-Han] Macau Univ Sci & Technol, State Key Lab Qual Res Chinese Med, Taipa, Macau, Peoples R China; [Li, Guoping] Southwest Med Univ, Affiliated Hosp, Inflammat & Allerg Dis Lab, 25 Taiping St, Luzhou, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Song, Qi] Southwest Med Univ, Affiliated Hosp, Dept Cardiothorac Surg, 25 Taiping St, Luzhou, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Jie] Southwest Med Univ, Sichuan Key Lab Nucl Med & Mol Imaging, Affiliated Hosp, Dept Nucl Med, Luzhou, Sichuan, Peoples R China",Macau University of Science & Technology; Southwest Medical University; Southwest Medical University; Southwest Medical University,"Li, GP; Leung, ELH (corresponding author), Macau Univ Sci & Technol, State Key Lab Qual Res Chinese Med, Taipa, Macau, Peoples R China.",lzlgp@163.com; lhleung@must.edu.mo,"QIBIAO, WU/AAA-7621-2019","Wu, Qibiao/0000-0002-1670-1050",Macao Science and Technology Development Fund [0096/2018/A3],Macao Science and Technology Development Fund,This work is supported by the Macao Science and Technology Development Fund (Project code: 0096/2018/A3).,,60,10,11,1,18,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",0025-7974,1536-5964,,MEDICINE,Medicine (Baltimore),APR,2020,99,17,,,,,,,e19480,10.1097/MD.0000000000019480,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/MD.0000000000019480,,,17,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),General & Internal Medicine,ME5SP,32332600,"Green Published, gold",,,2024-11-25,WOS:000544715800011,View Full Record in Web of Science

To the best of the authors' knowledge, at present, no comprehensive review has been published. To review research on BGIC infarction after MHI, a literature search was performed using the PubMed database and relevant search terms. According to recent data, MHI may cause BGIC infarction due to mechanical vasospasm of the perforating vessels in pediatric patients. The anatomical characteristics of the growing brain in infancy, mineralization of the lenticulostriate arteries and viral infection may all play a part in BGIC infarction after MHI, which often occurs within 24 months. Symptoms are not as severe and tend to disappear in the early period. Computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging often shows BGIC infarction. There are also children with scattered calcification of the basal ganglia. Neural rehabilitation is a commonly accepted treatment. The prognosis of patients with BGIC infarction after MHI consistently improves.","[Wang, Guangming; Luan, Yongxin; Feng, Lu; Yu, Jinlu] Jilin Univ, Hosp 1, Dept Neurosurg, 71 Xinmin Ave, Changchun 130021, Jilin, Peoples R China",Jilin University,"Yu, JL (corresponding author), Jilin Univ, Hosp 1, Dept Neurosurg, 71 Xinmin Ave, Changchun 130021, Jilin, Peoples R China.",jlyu@jlu.edu.cn,"Yu, Jinlu/S-7854-2019","Yu, Jinlu/0000-0003-2329-7946",,,,,49,5,5,0,4,SPANDIDOS PUBL LTD,ATHENS,"POB 18179, ATHENS, 116 10, GREECE",1792-0981,1792-1015,,EXP THER MED,Exp.

However, the efficacy and safety of this combination therapy for advanced NSCLC remain controversial. The objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of CKI combined with PBC on patients with stage III/IV non-small cell lung cancer. Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed following the PRISMA (Preferred Reported Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis) guidelines. All randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing CKI in combination with PBC versus PBC alone were retrieved and assessed for inclusion. Analyses were performed using Review Manager 5.3 (Copenhagen: The Nordic Cochrane Centre, The Cochrane Collaboration, 2014), Comprehensive Meta-Analysis 3.0 (Biostat, Englewood, NJ, United States; 2016) and Trial Sequential Analysis software (TSA) (Copenhagen Trial Unit, Centre for Clinical Intervention Research, Copenhagen, Denmark; 2011). The disease control rate (DCR) was regarded as the primary outcome, and the objective response rate (ORR), quality of life (QOL), survival rate, and toxicities were the secondary outcomes. Results: Thirty-seven trials, recruiting 3,272 patients with stage III/IV NSCLC, were included. The results showed that, CKI combined with PBC resulted in significant improvements in DCR (RR = 1.11, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.15, P < 0.00001), ORR (RR = 1.30, 95% CI 1.20 to 1.40, P < 0.00001), QOL (RR = 1.73, 95% CI 1.55 to 1.92, P < 0.00001), 1-year survival rate (RR = 1.51, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.94, P = 0.001), and a 58% decline in the incidence of severe toxicities (RR = 0.42, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.49, P < 0.00001). Conclusions: From the available evidence, our data indicate that CKI plus platinum-based chemotherapy is more effective in improving clinical efficacy and alleviating the toxicity of chemotherapy than platinum-based chemotherapy alone in the treatment of stage III/IV NSCLC. However, considering the intrinsic limitations of the included trials, high-quality RCTs with survival outcomes are still needed to further confirm our findings.","[Chen, Hongwei; Yao, Xiaojun; Li, Ting; Lam, Christopher Wai-Kei; Zhang, Ruonan; Zhang, Huixia; Wang, Jue; Zhang, Wei; Leung, Elaine Lai-Han; Wu, Qibiao] Macau Univ Sci & Technol, State Key Lab Qual Res Chinese Med, Ave Wai Long, Taipa 999078, Macau, Peoples R China; [Chen, Hongwei; Lam, Christopher Wai-Kei] Macau Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Med, Ave Wai Long, Taipa 999078, Macau, Peoples R China; [Yao, Xiaojun; Li, Ting; Zhang, Ruonan; Zhang, Huixia; Wang, Jue; Zhang, Wei; Leung, Elaine Lai-Han; Wu, Qibiao] Macau Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Chinese Med, Ave Wai Long, Taipa 999078, Macau, Peoples R China",Macau University of Science & Technology; Macau University of Science & Technology; Macau University of Science & Technology,"Zhang, W; Leung, ELH; Wu, QB (corresponding author), Macau Univ Sci & Technol, State Key Lab Qual Res Chinese Med, Ave Wai Long, Taipa 999078, Macau, Peoples R China.;Zhang, W; Leung, ELH; Wu, QB (corresponding author), Macau Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Chinese Med, Ave Wai Long, Taipa 999078, Macau, Peoples R China.",wzhang@must.edu.mo; lhleung@must.edu.mo; qbwu@mustedu.mo,"Chen, Hongwei/AAN-2868-2020; QIBIAO, WU/AAA-7621-2019; Lam, Christopher/B-6537-2009; zhang, wei/I-9335-2016","Chen, Hongwei/0000-0001-9010-9728; zhang, wei/0000-0002-8340-0821; Wu, Qibiao/0000-0002-1670-1050","Science and Technology Development Fund, Macau SAR [130/2017/A3, 0099/2018/A3, 0052/2018/A2, 0096/2018/A3]","Science and Technology Development Fund, Macau SAR","This work was funded by the Science and Technology Development Fund, Macau SAR (File No. 130/2017/A3, 0099/2018/A3, 0052/2018/A2 and 0096/2018/A3).",,87,26,27,1,16,IVYSPRING INT PUBL,LAKE HAVEN,"PO BOX 4546, LAKE HAVEN, NSW 2263, AUSTRALIA",1837-9664,,,J CANCER,J.

Our primary outcomes were PRISMA recommendations endorsement by the journal and 2017 journal impact factor. We assessed systematic review methodological quality using the AMSTAR-2 (A MeaSurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews) and reported descriptive statistics. A multivariate linear regression model was built. We assessed 66 systematic reviews published in 42 journals. Thirty-seven journals had an impact factor (mean 4.0, SD 4.8). 55% journals endorsed the PRISMA recommendations. The methodological quality of 75.8% systematic reviews was critically low. Journals with higher impact factor were associated with journals endorsing the PRISMA recommendations (ss 3.7; 95% CI 1.2, 6.3), but were not associated with the reviews' methodological quality (ss - 0.3; 95% CI - 4.8, 4.3). Limitations Our findings may not be generalized to other study populations and interventions such as medical devices, surgery and medication. Conclusions Three out of every four published low back pain systematic reviews had critically low methodological quality. Journals with higher impact factor were associated with journals endorsing the PRISMA recommendations. Clinicians must know how to critically appraise reviews. Journals' editorial policies should include the assessment of study methodological quality and reporting in the review process of an article.

Methods: Abstracts of systematic reviews and meta-analyses in orthodontics published in PubMed, Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews databases before March 23, 2018, that met the predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria, were evaluated using the 12 items of PRISMA-A, scoring each item from 0 to 2. Abstracts were classified into 2 groups: before and after publication of the PRISMA-A checklist. Three calibrated evaluators (intraclass correlation coefficient and kappa > 0.8) assessed the scores for compliance with the checklist. The number of authors, country of affiliation of the first author, performance of meta-analysis, and topic of the article were recorded. A regression analysis was performed to assess the associations between abstract characteristics and the PRISMA-A scores. Results: Of 1034 abstracts evaluated, 389 were included in the analysis. The mean PRISMA-A score was 53.39 (95% CI, 51.83-54.96). The overall score for studies published after the publication of the checklist was significantly higher than for studies published before (P <= 0.0001). The components returning significantly higher scores after publication of PRISMA-A were title (P = 0.024), information from databases (P = 0.026), risk of bias (P <= 0.0001), included studies (P <= 0.0001), synthesis of results (P <= 0.0001), interpretation of results (P = 0.035), financing and conflict of interest (P <= 0.0001), and registration (P <= 0.0001). These results showed the positive effect of PRISMA-A had on the quality of reporting of orthodontics systematic reviews. Nevertheless, the poor adherence revealed that there is still need for improvement in the quality of abstract reporting. Conclusions: The quality of reporting of abstracts of orthodontic systematic reviews and meta-analyses increased after the introduction of PRISMA-A.","[Vasquez-Cardenas, Jenny; Zapata-Norena, Oscar; Carvsjal-Florez, Alvaro; Barbosa-Liz, Diana Maria] Univ Antioguia, Fac Dent, Gionorto Res Grp, Orthodont Postgrad Program, Medellin, Colombia; [Giannakopoulos, Nikoiaos Nikitas] Univ Wurzburg, Fac Med, Dept Prosthodont, Wurzburg, Germany; [Faggion, Clovis Lariano, Jr.] Univ Wurzburg, Fac Dent, Dept Periodontol & Operat Dent, Wurzburg, Germany",University of Wurzburg; University of Wurzburg,"Barbosa-Liz, DM (corresponding author), Univ Antioguia, Fac Dent, Orthodont Postgrad Program, Calle 70 52-21, Medellin, Colombia.",dimabarbosa@gmail.com,"Giannakopoulos, Nikolaos/Q-7658-2017","Giannakopoulos, Nikolaos Nikitas/0000-0002-2887-8857","Faculty of Dentistry, University of Antioquia","Faculty of Dentistry, University of Antioquia","This study was supported by the Faculty of Dentistry, University of Antioquia.

In this study, we have performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of published trials to confirm the clinical efficacy and safety of sTPs, and determine the optimal types, usages, and sTP/chemotherapy combinations to produce the desired responses. Materials and methods: We collected all studies regarding combined sTP therapy and chemotherapy for NSCLC from the Chinese and English databases (up to October 2018). Bias risk was evaluated for each. Data for metaanalysis was extracted using a pre-designed form. Evidence quality was rated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. Results: We included 27 randomized controlled trials containing 1925 patients, most with unclear bias risk. Combining sTPs with chemotherapy significantly increased the objective response rate [1.28, (1.13 to 1.45)], disease control rate [1.10, (1.01 to 1.18)], quality of life (QOL) [2.05, (1.62, 2.60)], and 1-year overall survival rate [1.43, (1.15 to 1.78)], with decreased risks of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and gastrointestinal reactions. Optimal conditions included treatment in combination with gemcitabine or navelbine and cisplatin, twice a week, with one 3-week cycle. In these conditions, thymosin al improved both antitumor immunity and tumor response. Most results had good robustness, and their quality ranged from moderate to very low. Conclusions: The results suggest that treatment with sTPs, especially thymosin al, and concomitant chemotherapy is beneficial to the patient, and provide evidence for optimal treatment regimens that may increase patient QOL and survival.","[Zeng, Fen-Lian; Xiao, Zheng; Wang, Cheng-Qiong; Shan, Jing-Li; Xiao, Xue] Zunyi Med Univ, Dept Gen Med, Affiliated Hosp, Zunyi 563003, Guizhou, Peoples R China; [Xiao, Zheng; Wang, Cheng-Qiong; Jiang, Yuan; Shan, Jing-Li; Xiao, Xue] Zunyi Med Univ, Evidence Based Med Ctr, MOE Virtual Res Ctr Evidence Based Med, Affiliated Hosp, Zunyi 563003, Guizhou, Peoples R China; [Xiao, Zheng; Jiang, Yuan; Tang, Yu-Hong] Zunyi Med Univ, Sch Management, Zunyi 563003, Guizhou, Peoples R China; [Zeng, Fen-Lian] Zunyi Med Univ, Dept Clin Nursing, Affiliated Hosp, Zunyi 563003, Guizhou, Peoples R China; [Hu, Shan-Shan; Huang, Xiao-Rong] Zunyi Med Univ, GCP Ctr, Affiliated Hosp, Zunyi 563003, Guizhou, Peoples R China; [Yao, Xing-Sheng] Zunyi Med Univ, Dept Immunol, Special Key Lab Gene Detect & Therapy Guizhou Pro, Zunyi 563000, Guizhou, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Tao] Zunyi Med Univ, Key Lab Cell Engn Guizhou Prov, Affiliated Hosp, Zunyi 519000, Guizhou, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Tao] Zunyi Med Univ, Regenerat Med Ctr, Affiliated Hosp, Zunyi 519000, Guizhou, Peoples R China; [Feng, Ji-Hong] Taizhou Univ, Dept Oncol, Med Coll, Affiliated Taizhou Municipal Hosp, Taizhou 318000, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Zeng, Xian-Tao] Wuhan Univ, Ctr Evidence Based & Translat Med, Zhongnan Hosp, Wuhan 430071, Hubei, Peoples R China",Zunyi Medical University; Zunyi Medical University; Zunyi Medical University; Zunyi Medical University; Zunyi Medical University; Zunyi Medical University; Zunyi Medical University; Zunyi Medical University; Taizhou University; Wuhan University,"Xiao, X (corresponding author), Zunyi Med Univ, Dept Gen Med, Affiliated Hosp, Zunyi 563003, Guizhou, Peoples R China.;Xiao, Z (corresponding author), Zunyi Med Univ, Affiliated Hosp, Dept Gen Med, Evidence Based Med Ctr,MOE Virtual Res Ctr Eviden, Zunyi 563003, Guizhou, Peoples R China.",zy426f@163.com; xxellen@163.com,"Huang, Xiaorong/GVU-4903-2022; Zhang, Jinwei/Q-7959-2019","Zeng, Xian-Tao/0000-0003-1262-725X",Science and Technology Foundation of Guizhou Province [(2016)7485]; special funds for academic seedlings training and innovation at Zunyi Medical College [(2017) 5733-034]; Special Funds for Science and Technology Research of Traditional Chinese and National Medicine in Guizhou [QZYY 2017-084]; High-level Innovative Talent Program in Guizhou [fzc120171001]; Doctoral Fund of Zunyi Medical College [F-617]; Science and Technology Bureau and Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical College [(2016)7485],Science and Technology Foundation of Guizhou Province; special funds for academic seedlings training and innovation at Zunyi Medical College; Special Funds for Science and Technology Research of Traditional Chinese and National Medicine in Guizhou; High-level Innovative Talent Program in Guizhou; Doctoral Fund of Zunyi Medical College; Science and Technology Bureau and Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical College,"This study was funded by joint funds for science and technology from Science and Technology Foundation of Guizhou Province, Science and Technology Bureau and Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical College [No. (2016)7485], special funds for academic seedlings training and innovation at Zunyi Medical College [Qian Kehe Pingtai Rencai No. (2017) 5733-034], Special Funds for Science and Technology Research of Traditional Chinese and National Medicine in Guizhou (No. QZYY 2017-084), a High-level Innovative Talent Program in Guizhou (No. fzc120171001), and the Doctoral Fund of Zunyi Medical College (No. F-617).",,81,9,11,0,22,ELSEVIER,AMSTERDAM,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",1567-5769,1878-1705,,INT IMMUNOPHARMACOL,Int.

Material and methods: Three hundred and forty-nine articles were retrieved in the PubMed and Cochrane databases using the search-terms stylohyoid syndrome and synonyms. Articles documenting treatment and outcome with more than 1 month's follow-up were selected. Treatment-related complications and rate of cure, defined as disappearance of symptoms and/or of revelatory complication, were analyzed. Overall analysis was performed for series and a mixed logistic regression model for case reports. Results: Hundred and two articles (12 series, 90 case reports) were selected. The 12 series included 482 patients with pain syndrome managed by styloidectomy, with 84.2% and 73.7% cure rates for cervical and transoral approaches, respectively. There were no complications with the transoral approach, versus 1.2% transient facial paresis with the cervical approach. In the 90 case reports, 112 patients had pain syndrome (Group I) and 16 neurological deficit (Group II). Cure rate in Group I varied significantly (P=0.005; OR 8.33, 95% CI [2.12-32.81]) from 64.3% following medical treatment (antiepileptics, muscle relaxants, analgesics, per os and/or locally injected anti-inflammatory drugs) to 91.8% following styloidectomy, without any significant impact of surgical approach (P = 0.1; OR 0.17, 95% CI [0.02-1.60]). In Group I, no complications occurred after medical treatment, versus 4.3% and 16.3% after transoral and cervical styloidectomy, respectively. In Group II, cure and complication rates were 87.5% and 6.2%, respectively. Due to the small sample size and heterogeneity of Group II, no statistical assessment of the contribution of styloidectomy to medical treatment (antiplatelet drugs, with or without stenting) was performed. Conclusion: Styloidectomy appears to be the treatment of choice for stylohyoid syndrome. The surgical approach does not significantly influence the cure or complications rate.

However, the results of current studies are controversial and the effects of these neuraxial adjuvants remain unclear. AIM To evaluate the effects of neuraxial adjuvants on perioperative shivering during cesarean sections, thus providing an optimal choice for clinical application. METHODS A systematic review and network meta-analysis were conducted following the PRISMA (Preferred Reported Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis) guidelines. Analyses were performed using Review Manager 5.3 and Stata 14.0. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central databases for eligible clinical trials assessing the effects of neuraxial adjuvants on perioperative shivering and other adverse events during cesarean sections. Perioperative shivering was defined as the primary endpoint, and nausea, vomiting, pruritus, hypotension, and bradycardia were the secondary outcomes. RESULTS Twenty-six studies using 9 neuraxial adjuvants for obstetric anesthesia during caesarean sections were included. The results showed that, compared with placebo, pethidine, fentanyl, dexmedetomidine, and sufentanil significantly reduced the incidence of perioperative shivering. Among the four neuraxial adjuvants, pethidine was the most effective one for shivering prevention (OR = 0.15, 95%CI: 0.07-0.35, surface under the cumulative ranking curve 83.9), but with a high incidence of nausea (OR = 3.15, 95%CI: 1.04-9.57) and vomiting (OR = 3.71, 95%CI: 1.81-7.58). The efficacy of fentanyl for shivering prevention was slightly inferior to pethidine (OR = 0.20, 95%CI: 0.09-0.43), however, it significantly decreased the incidence of nausea (OR = 0.34, 95%CI: 0.15-0.79) and vomiting (OR = 0.25, 95%CI: 0.11-0.56). In addition, compared with sufentanil, fentanyl showed no impact on haemodynamic stability and the incidence of pruritus. CONCLUSION Pethidine, fentanyl, dexmedetomidine, and sufentanil appear to be effective for preventing perioperative shivering in puerperae undergoing cesarean sections. Considering the risk-benefit profiles of the included neuraxial adjuvants, fentanyl is probably the optimal choice.","[Zhang, Yi-Wei; Wu, Qi-Biao] Macau Univ Sci & Technol, State Key Lab Qual Res Chinese Med, Ave Wai Long, Macau 999078, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yi-Wei; Li, Li-Fang; Wu, Qi-Biao] Macau Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Chinese Med, Macau 999078, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Juan; Hu, Jia-Qi; Wen, Chun-Lei] Zhejiang Chinese Med Univ, Affiliated Hosp 1, Dept Anesthesiol, Llangzhou 310000, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Hu, Jia-Qi] Zhejiang Prov Peoples Hosp, Dept Pain, Hangzhou 310000, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Dai, Shu-Yang] Wenzhou Med Univ, Ruian Peoples Hosp, Dept Anesthesiol, Wenzhou 325000, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Yang, Dan-Feng] Zhejiang Univ, Sir Run Run Shaw Hosp, Sch Med, Dept Anesthesiol, Hangzhou 310000, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Macau University of Science & Technology; Macau University of Science & Technology; Zhejiang Chinese Medical University; Hangzhou Medical College; Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital; Wenzhou Medical University; Zhejiang University,"Wu, QB (corresponding author), Macau Univ Sci & Technol, State Key Lab Qual Res Chinese Med, Ave Wai Long, Macau 999078, Peoples R China.",qbwu@must.edu.mo,"Hu, Jiaqi/GZM-6342-2022; QIBIAO, WU/AAA-7621-2019","Wu, Qibiao/0000-0002-1670-1050","Science and Technology Development Fund, Macau SAR [130/2017/A3, 0099/2018/A3]","Science and Technology Development Fund, Macau SAR","Supported by The Science and Technology Development Fund, Macau SAR, No. 130/2017/A3 and No. 0099/2018/A3.",,48,12,12,0,16,BAISHIDENG PUBLISHING GROUP INC,PLEASANTON,"7041 Koll Center Parkway, Suite 160, PLEASANTON, CA, UNITED STATES",2307-8960,,,WORLD J CLIN CASES,World J.

Although acupuncture systematic reviews share several essential elements with other systematic reviews, some essential information for the application of acupuncture is not covered by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. Considering this, we aimed to develop an extension of the PRISMA statement for acupuncture systematic reviews. Methods We used the PRISMA statement as a starting point, and conducted this study referring to the development strategy recommended by the EQUATOR network. The initial items were collected through a wide survey among evidence users and a review of relevant studies. We conducted a three-round Delphi survey and one-day face-to-face meeting to select items and formulate the checklist. After the consensus meeting, we drafted the manuscript (including the checklist) and sent it to our advisory experts for comments, following which the checklist was refined and circulated to a group of acupuncture systematic review authors for pilot test. We also selected a sample of acupuncture systematic reviews published in 2017 to test the checklist. Results A checklist of five new sub-items (including sub items) and six modified items was formulated, involving content related to title, rationale, eligibility criteria, literature search, data extraction, and study characteristics. We clarified the rationales of the items and provided examples for each item for additional guidance. Conclusion The PRISMA for Acupuncture checklist is developed for improving the reporting of systematic reviews of acupuncture interventions.","[Wang, Xiaoqin; Chen, Yaolong; Liu, Yali; Tian, Jinhui; Ma, Bin; Yang, Kehu] Lanzhou Univ, Evidence Based Med Ctr, Sch Basic Med Sci, Lanzhou, Gansu, Peoples R China; [Wang, Xiaoqin; Chen, Yaolong; Liu, Yali; Tian, Jinhui; Ma, Bin; Yang, Kehu] Lanzhou Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, Evidence Based Social Sci Res Ctr, Lanzhou, Gansu, Peoples R China; [Wang, Xiaoqin; Chen, Yaolong; Liu, Yali; Tian, Jinhui; Ma, Bin; Yang, Kehu] Key Lab Evidence Based Med & Knowledge Translat G, Lanzhou, Gansu, Peoples R China; [Wang, Xiaoqin; Chen, Yaolong; Liu, Yali; Tian, Jinhui; Ma, Bin; Yang, Kehu] WHO Collaborating Ctr Guideline Implementat & Kno, Lanzhou, Gansu, Peoples R China; [Yao, Liang; Bian, Zhaoxiang] Hong Kong Baptist Univ, Clin Div, Sch Chinese Med, Kowloon Tong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Estill, Janne] Univ Geneva, Inst Global Hlth, Geneva, Switzerland; [Estill, Janne] Univ Genewa, Inst Math Stat & Actuarial Sci, Geneva, Switzerland; [Wu, Taixiang] Sichuan Univ, West China Hosp, Chinese Cochrane Ctr, Chinese Evidence Based Med Ctr, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Shang, Hongcai; Tian, Guihua] Beijing Univ Chinese Med, Dongzhimen Hosp, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Lee, Myeong Soo] Korea Inst Oriental Med, Daejeon, South Korea; [Wei, Dang] Karolinska Inst, Dept Publ Hlth Sci, Stockholm, Sweden; [Wang, Yongfeng] Gansu Univ Chinese Med, Lanzhou, Gansu, Peoples R China",Lanzhou University; Lanzhou University; Hong Kong Baptist University; University of Geneva; Sichuan University; Beijing University of Chinese Medicine; Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine (KIOM); Karolinska Institutet; Gansu University of Chinese Medicine,"Chen, YL; Yang, KH (corresponding author), Lanzhou Univ, Evidence Based Med Ctr, Sch Basic Med Sci, Lanzhou, Gansu, Peoples R China.",wangxiaoqin0822@163.com; chenyaolong21@163.com; kehuyangebm2006@126.com,"Yao, Liang (liam)/KPA-1601-2024; wang, zhenhui/JMQ-0550-2023; Tian, Guihua/AGM-8110-2022; Lee, Myeong Soo/C-8147-2013",,"National Natural Science Foundation of China [81373882]; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities [16LZUJBWTD013, 18LZUJBWZX006]",National Natural Science Foundation of China(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities),"This study is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (General Program, ID: 81373882) and the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (16LZUJBWTD013, 18LZUJBWZX006): Evidence-based Social Sciences Research.

Therefore, novel biomarkers are necessary that can help with estimating prognosis and improving clinical outcomes of patients with sepsis. Methods: The gene expression profiles GSE54514 and GSE63042 were downloaded from the GEO database. DEGs were screened by t test after logarithmization of raw data; then, the common DEGs between the 2 gene expression profiles were identified by up-regulation and down-regulation intersection. The DEGs were analyzed using bioinformatics, and a protein-protein interaction (PPI) survival network was constructed using STRING. Survival curves were constructed to explore the relationship between core genes and the prognosis of sepsis patients based on GSE54514 data. Results: A total of 688 common DEGs were identified between survivors and non-survivors of sepsis, and 96 genes were involved in survival networks. The crucial genes Signal transducer and activator of transcription 5A (STAT5A), CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein beta (CEBPB), Myc proto-oncogene protein (MYC), and REL-associated protein (RELA) were identified and showed increased expression in sepsis survivors. These crucial genes had a positive correlation with patients' survival time according to the survival analysis. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that the genes STAT5A, CEBPB, MYC, and RELA may be important in predicting the prognosis of sepsis patients.","[Hu, Yingchun; Zhong, Wu; Chen, Muhu] Southwest Med Univ, Affiliated Hosp, Dept Emergency, Lu Zhou, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Qian] Southwest Med Univ, Affiliated Hosp, Dept Infect Dis, 25 Taiping St, Lu Zhou 646000, Sichuan, Peoples R China",Southwest Medical University; Southwest Medical University,"Zhang, Q (corresponding author), Southwest Med Univ, Affiliated Hosp, Dept Infect Dis, 25 Taiping St, Lu Zhou 646000, Sichuan, Peoples R China.",782872184@qq.com,"Hu, Ying/GQZ-8100-2022",,Luzhou-SWMU united project [2017LZXNYD-J27],Luzhou-SWMU united project,This work was sponsored by the Luzhou-SWMU united project (2017LZXNYD-J27).,,22,7,7,0,1,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",0025-7974,1536-5964,,MEDICINE,Medicine (Baltimore),AUG,2019,98,33,,,,,,,e16807,10.1097/MD.0000000000016807,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/MD.0000000000016807,,,7,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),General & Internal Medicine,IY4QR,31415393,"gold, Green Published",,,2024-11-25,WOS:000486378600047,View Full Record in Web of Science

Recently, the relationship between platelet parameters and DR has become a hot topic. Whether platelet parameters have clinical value in DR is controversial. Methods: Literature was retrieved by formal search of electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane library, Scopus, and CNKI) and by hand searching of reference lists of related articles from the beginning of building database to December 2017. Review manager 5.3 was utilized to deal with statistical data. This study was registered at International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (number: CRD42018093773). Results: This study included 1720 DR patients, 1477 type 2 diabetic mellitus (T2DM) without DR patients and 1456 health controls in 21 eligible studies. We found there was significant increase of platelet distribution width (PDW) level in the comparison of DR versus Control group (standard mean difference [SMD] [95% confidence interval [CI]]= 1.04 [0.68, 1.40]) and DR versus T2DM without DR group (SMD [95% CI]= 0.68 [0.40, 0.95]). For platelet count (PLT), it showed obvious decrease in the comparison of DR versus T2DM without DR group (SMD [95% CI]= -0.26 [-0.49, -0.03]) and no difference in comparison of DR versus Control (SMD [95% CI]= -0.26 [-0.51, -0.00]). Subgroup analysis showed that significant result of PDW level appeared in China and Turkey in all comparisons, while similar results of PLT only in China. In addition, PDW level was different in various DR-subtypes, obvious high level in proliferation DR. Conclusions: We concluded that the guiding significance of PDW and PLT in diagnosis and monitor of DR, and especially, application of PDW to PDR management may have potential sense.","[Ji, Shuaifei; Ning, Xiaona; Zhang, Jie] Fourth Mil Med Univ, Dept Ophthalmol, Tangdu Hosp, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Babo; Shi, Heng; Liu, Zheng] Fourth Mil Med Univ, Sch Basic Med, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China",Air Force Military Medical University; Air Force Military Medical University,"Zhang, J (corresponding author), Fourth Mil Med Univ, Dept Ophthalmol, Tangdu Hosp, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",jessicazhangjie@hotmail.com,"Zhang, Jie/GLU-4515-2022; ji, shuaifei/AGM-7583-2022",,,,,,41,5,5,0,7,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",0025-7974,1536-5964,,MEDICINE,Medicine (Baltimore),JUL,2019,98,29,,,,,,,e16510,10.1097/MD.0000000000016510,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/MD.0000000000016510,,,8,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),General & Internal Medicine,IQ4TG,31335726,"Green Published, gold",,,2024-11-25,WOS:000480742900060,View Full Record in Web of Science

The aim of this study was to assess the reporting quality of systematic reviews of interventions aimed at improving vaccination coverage using the recommended Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guideline. PubMed and Cochrane Library were searched to identify SRs of interventions to improve immunization coverage, indexed up to May 2016. Two authors independently screened the search output, assessed study eligibility, and extracted data from eligible SRs using a 27-item data collection form derived from PRISMA. Discrepancies in reviews assessments were resolved by discussion and consensus. A total of 57 reviews were included in this study with a mean percentage of applicable PRISMA items that were met across all studies of 66% (range 19-100%) and median compliance of 70%. 39 out of the 57 reviews were published after the release of the PRISMA statement in 2009. Highest compliance was observed in items related to the description of rational, description of eligibility criteria, synthesis of results and provision of a general interpretation of the results (items #3, #6, #14 and #26, respectively). Compliance was poorest in the items describing summary of evidence (item 24, 19%), describing indication of review protocol and registration (item 5, 26%) and describing results of risk of bias across studies (item 22, 33%). The overall reporting quality of systematic reviews of interventions to improve vaccination coverage requires significant improvement. There remains a need for additional research targeted at addressing potential barriers to compliance and strategies to improve compliance with PRISMA guideline.","[Ndze, Valantine Ngum; Jaca, Anelisa; Wiysonge, Charles Shey] Stellenbosch Univ, Fac Med & Hlth Sci, Dept Global Hlth, Ctr Evidence Based Hlth Care,Div Epidemiol & Bios, Cape Town, South Africa; [Ndze, Valantine Ngum] Univ Yaounde I, Fac Med & Biomed Sci, Yaounde, Cameroon; [Jaca, Anelisa; Wiysonge, Charles Shey] Cochrane South Africa, South African Med Res Council, Cape Town, South Africa; [Wiysonge, Charles Shey] Univ Cape Town, Sch Publ Hlth & Family Med, Div Epidemiol & Biostat, Cape Town, South Africa",Stellenbosch University; University of Yaounde I; South African Medical Research Council; University of Cape Town,"Ndze, VN (corresponding author), Stellenbosch Univ, Fac Med & Hlth Sci, Dept Global Hlth, Ctr Evidence Based Hlth Care,Div Epidemiol & Bios, Cape Town, South Africa.",Valantinengum@yahoo.com,"Wiysonge, Charles/A-3843-2008","Wiysonge, Charles/0000-0002-1273-4779; Ndze, Valantine/0000-0003-2200-6203","Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences strategic research Fund, Stellenbosch University, South Africa","Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences strategic research Fund, Stellenbosch University, South Africa","The Dean of the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences strategic research Fund, Stellenbosch University, South Africa",,71,4,4,1,7,TAYLOR & FRANCIS INC,PHILADELPHIA,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",2164-5515,2164-554X,,HUM VACC IMMUNOTHER,Human Vaccines Immunother.,DEC 2,2019,15,12,,,,,2836,2843,,10.1080/21645515.2019.1623998,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/21645515.2019.1623998,,JUN 2019,8,Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Immunology,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Biotechnology & Applied Microbiology; Immunology,KK3UW,31166843,"Green Published, Bronze",,,2024-11-25,WOS:000475212500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Its active ingredients are beta-, gamma- and delta-elemene, which are extracted from Curcuma aromatica Salisb. (Curcuma wenyujin Y.H. Chen & C. Ling). Purpose: To evaluate the effects of Elemene injection as adjunctive treatment to platinum-based chemotherapy (PBC) in patients with stage III/IV non-small cell lung cancer. Study design: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials (RCTs). Materials and methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted following the PRISMA (Preferred Reported Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis) guidelines. Analyses were performed using Review Manager 5.3, Comprehensive Meta-Analysis 3.0 and Trial Sequential Analysis software. All RCTs comparing Elemene injection combined with PBC vs. PBC alone were selected and assessed for inclusion. The disease control rate (DCR) was defined as the primary endpoint, and the objective Response rate (ORR), survival rate, quality of life (QOL), cellular immune function and toxicities were the secondary outcomes. Results: 15 RCTs recruiting 1,410 patients with stage III/IV NSCLC were included. The methodological quality of most included trials was low to moderate. Compared with PBC alone, Elemene injection plus PBC can improve DCR (RR = 1.23, 95% CI 1.16 to 1.31, p < 0.00001), ORR (RR = 1.62, 95% CI 1.44 to 1.82, p < 0.00001), 1- and 2-year survival rates (RR = 1.33, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.59, p = 0.002; RR = 1.73, 95% CI 1.21 to 2.46, p = 0.002, respectively), QOL (RR = 1.91, 95% CI 1.58 to 2.32, p < 0.00001), CD4+ T cell counts (WMD = 10.43, 95% CI 8.25 to 12.62, p < 0.00001), and the CD4+/CD8+ ratio (WMD = 0.78, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.14, p < 0.0001) and can reduce severe toxicities by 58% (RR = 0.42, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.52, p < 0.00001). Conclusion: Elemene injection is a safe and effective adjunctive treatment to platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with stage III/IV NSCLC.

The absence of precise prescription recommendations to treat arterial hypertension (HT) lead to use drugs unable to reduce blood pressure (BP) to target values. We published ATOM study, in which we found significant differences in the ability to reduce BP between the different drugs. The objective of the study was to determine the expected decrease in blood pressure with the use of commercialized doses of the drugs commonly used in the treatment of HT in clinical practice, to avoid the use of drugs or combinations that even with the best response, are unable to obtain the necessary BP decrease to reach the goal. Methods: The analysis was based on the results of the ATOM study. To convert the mean doses of the different drugs and combinations in commercialized doses, the conclusions of the study by Law et al have been applied. Results: Based on the results, two tables were drawn, one for systolic BP and the other for diastolic BP, where the doses of the different drugs and combinations are classified according to the BP decrease that can be expected from them. In order to favor the use of the tables in clinical practice, the different drugs have been grouped in intervals of 10 millimeters of mercury (mmHg) for the decrease of the systolic BP and of 5 mmHg for the diastolic BP. Conclusions: Recommendations for the use of antihypertensive treatments should not be limited to pharmacological families. They should also consider differences between drugs or specific combinations. From the data of the ATOM study we have implemented tables that express the effect of the drugs commonly used in clinical practice and that should allow the clinicians to choose with care the treatment to use.","[Paz, Marco A.] Hosp Santa Caterina, Carrer Dr Castany S-N, Salt 17190, Girona, Spain; [Paz, Marco A.; Coll de Tuero, Gabriel] Univ Girona, Dept Med Sci, Girona, Spain; [Farrerons, Monica; Saez, Marc; Saurina, Carme; Garcia Pinto, Marc] Univ Girona, Res Grp Stat Econometr & Hlth GRECS, Girona, Spain; [Farrerons, Monica] Univ Girona, Girona, Spain; [Saez, Marc; Saurina, Carme; Coll de Tuero, Gabriel] CIBER Epidemiol & Publ Hlth CIBERESP, Madrid, Spain; [Castro, Sonia] Primary Care Ctr Can Gibert Pla, Girona, Spain; [Sobrino, Javier] Univ Barcelon, Fundacio Hosp Esperit St, Santa Coloma Gramanet, Barcelona, Spain; [Coll de Tuero, Gabriel] Univ Inst Res Primary Care Jordi Gol IdIAPGol, Res Support Unit, Girona, Spain",Universitat de Girona; Universitat de Girona; Universitat de Girona; CIBER - Centro de Investigacion Biomedica en Red; CIBERESP; Autonomous University of Barcelona; University of Barcelona,"Paz, MA (corresponding author), Hosp Santa Caterina, Carrer Dr Castany S-N, Salt 17190, Girona, Spain.",marcopaz18@hotmail.com,"Paz, Miguel/E-5414-2010",,,,,,17,2,2,0,1,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",0025-7974,1536-5964,,MEDICINE,Medicine (Baltimore),APR,2019,98,15,,,,,,,e15010,10.1097/MD.0000000000015010,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/MD.0000000000015010,,,5,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),General & Internal Medicine,HX3YM,30985647,"Green Published, gold",,,2024-11-25,WOS:000467331500008,View Full Record in Web of Science

Important sources of evidence are systematic reviews (SRs) and meta-analyses (MAs), but these can only be informative provided their quality is sufficiently high, which can only be assessed if reporting is adequate. The purpose of this study was to assess the quality of reporting of SRs and MAs in emergency medicine using the PRISMA statement. Methods: The top five emergency medicine related journals were selected using the 5-year impact factor of the ISI Web of Knowledge of 2015. All SRs and MAs published in these journals between 2015 and 2016 were extracted and assessed independently by two reviewers on compliance with each item of the PRISMA statement. Results: The included reviews (n = 112) reported a mean of 18 +/- 4 items of the PRISMA statement adequately. Reviews mentioning PRISMA adherence did not show better reporting than review without mention of adherence (mean 18.6 (SE 0.4) vs. mean 17.8 (SE 0.5); p = 0.214). Reviews published in journals recommending or requiring adherence to a reporting guideline showed better quality of reporting than journals without such instructions (mean 19.2 (SE 0.4) vs. mean 17.2 (SE 0.5); p = 0.001). Conclusion: There is room for improvement of the quality of reporting of SRs and MAs within the emergency medicine literature. Therefore, authors should use a reporting guideline such as the PRISMA statement. Active journal implementation, by requiring PRISMA endorsement, enhances quality of reporting.","[Nawijn, Femke; Ham, Wietske H. W.; Houwert, Roderick M.; Hietbrink, Falco; Smeeing, Diederik P.

However, the results remain inconsistent.Objectives:We conducted a meta-analysis to assess the clinical utility of miniprobe endoscopic ultrasonography for diagnostic of invasion depth of early GC.Methods:We systematically searched several online electronic databases including PubMed, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Web of Science, Embase, and Wanfang from initial library to July 20, 2018, identifying the study about miniprobe endoscopic ultrasonography for diagnostic of invasion depth of early GC. Bivariate mixed effects models were used to calculate the sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio (PLR), negative likelihood ratio (NLR), diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) with theirs 95% confidence intervals (CIs).Results:Nineteen studies with 3401 patients were included in the meta-analysis. The bivariate mixed effect model indicated that the overall diagnostic sensitivity was 0.86 (95%CI: 0.79-0.91) and the specificity was 0.73 (95%CI: 0.66-0.78). The area under the curve was 0.84 (95%CI: 0.81-0.87). We also estimated the other pooled parameters as follows: the pooled PLR was 3.13 (95%CI: 2.55-3.84), the pooled NLR was 0.19 (95%CI: 0.13-0.28), the diagnostic score was 2.78 (95%CI: 2.33-3.23), and the diagnostic odds ratio was 16.1 (95%CI: 10.23-25.36). Subgroup analysis indicated that ethnicity may be the decisive factor on heterogeneity.Conclusions:The present study indicated that the miniprobe endoscopic ultrasonography had a moderate diagnostic ability for invasion depth of early GC. The diagnostic utility was influenced by ethnicity. Further research is required to confirm the present findings and explore the potential factors of heterogeneity.","[Luo, Mingchi] Tianjin Univ TCM, Affiliated Hosp 2, 69 Zengchan Ave, Tianjin 300042, Peoples R China; [Li, Lifeng] Publ Secur Hosp Tianjin City, Dept Tradit Chinses Med, Tianjin 300042, Peoples R China",,"Luo, MC (corresponding author), Tianjin Univ TCM, Affiliated Hosp 2, 69 Zengchan Ave, Tianjin 300042, Peoples R China.;Li, LF (corresponding author), Publ Secur Hosp Tianjin City, Dept Tradit Chinses Med, Tianjin 300042, Peoples R China.",luomingchimed@foxmail.com; lilifeng86@qq.com,"Li, Lifeng/JRW-2275-2023",,,,,,27,29,31,0,10,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",0025-7974,1536-5964,,MEDICINE,Medicine (Baltimore),FEB,2019,98,6,,,,,,,e14430,10.1097/MD.0000000000014430,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/MD.0000000000014430,,,9,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),General & Internal Medicine,HQ6ZR,30732202,"Green Published, gold",,,2024-11-25,WOS:000462569300083,View Full Record in Web of Science

METHODS: MEDLINE (R) was searched for DTA systematic reviews published October 2017 to January 2018. The search time span was modulated to reach the desired sample size of 100 systematic reviews. Reporting on a per-item basis using PRISMA-DTA was evaluated. RESULTS: One hundred reviews were included. Mean reported items were 18.6 of 26 (71%; SD = 1.9) for PRISMA-DTA and 5.5 of 11 (50%; SD = 1.2) for PRISMA-DTA for abstracts. Items in the results were frequently reported. Items related to protocol registration, characteristics of included studies, results synthesis, and definitions used in data extraction were infrequently reported. Infrequently reported items from PRISMA-DTA for abstracts included funding information, strengths and limitations, characteristics of included studies, and assessment of applicability. Reporting completeness was higher in higher impact factor journals (18.9 vs 18.1 items; P = 0.04), studies that cited PRISMA (18.9 vs 17.7 items; P = 0.003), or used supplementary material (19.1 vs 18.0 items; P = 0.004). Variability in reporting was associated with author country (P = 0.04) but not journal (P = 0.6), abstract word count limitations (P = 0.9), PRISMA adoption (P = 0.2), structured abstracts (P = 0.2), study design (P = 0.8), subspecialty area (P = 0.09), or index test (P = 0.5). Abstracts with a higher word count were more informative (R = 0.4; P < 0.001). No association with word counts was observed for full-text reports (R = -0.03; P = 0.06). CONCLUSIONS: Recently published reports of DTA systematic reviews are not fully informative when evaluated against the PRISMA-DTA guidelines. These results should guide knowledge translation strategies, including journal level (e.g., PRISMA-DTA adoption, increased abstract word count, and use of supplementary material) and author level (PRISMA-DTA citation awareness) strategies.

Kahneman and Tversky's prospect theory has become the main model for the study of decision-making. One of its cornerstones, the loss aversion bias (greater sensitivity to losses than to gains), has been demonstrated from the behavioural perspective. Aims. To analyse the evidence from neuroeconomics and check whether it is consistent with the existence of a neural mechanism of loss aversion. Patients and methods. A systematic review was performed, following the PRISMA guidelines, of the empirical studies found in PubMed and ScienceDirect, a total of 18 studies being included altogether. Results and conclusions. The results consistently point to the implication of two opposing neural systems in this bias: one appetitive, involving the striatum and the frontal regions, and one aversive, involving the amygdala and the insula, which interact with each other when it comes to making a decision about different monetary bets and display a higher sensitivity towards losses. Although their functioning is not yet clear, what does seem evident is that the consistent involvement of these structures lends support to prospect theory and the limited rationality approach.","[Molins, Francisco; Serrano, Miguel A.] Univ Valencia, Dept Psicobiol, Avda Blasco Ibanez 21, E-46010 Valencia, Spain",University of Valencia,"Serrano, MA (corresponding author), Univ Valencia, Dept Psicobiol, Avda Blasco Ibanez 21, E-46010 Valencia, Spain.",m.angel.serrano@uv.es,"Molins, Francisco/ABF-7161-2021; Serrano, Miguel-Angel/AAZ-4393-2020","Serrano, Miguel-Angel/0000-0002-6574-4532",,,,,50,10,13,2,30,REVISTA DE NEUROLOGIA,BARCELONA,"C/O CESAR VIGUERA, EDITOR, APDO 94121, 08080 BARCELONA, SPAIN",0210-0010,1576-6578,,REV NEUROLOGIA,Rev.

Aidi injection plus paclitaxel-based chemotherapy is often used to in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in China. Aim of the study: The objective of this study is to further confirm whether Aidi injection can improve the tumor responses and survivals, and reveal its safety, optimal usage and combination with paclitaxel. Materials and methods: A meta-analysis was performed following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. All randomized controlled trials (RCTs) concerning the Aidi injection plus paclitaxel-based chemotherapy for NSCLC were selected. Main outcomes were objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), survivals, quality of life (QOL) and adverse drug reactions (ADRs). All data were extracted by using a standard data extraction form and synthesized through meta-analysis. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used for rating the quality of evidence. Results: Thirty-one RCTs involving 2058 patients were included, and most trials had an unclear methodological bias risk. The risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of ORR, DCR, QOL, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, gastrointestinal toxicity and liver injury were as following: 1.32 (1.20-L46), 1.14 (1.09-1.20), 1.89 (1.66-2.16), 0.61 (0.51-0.74), 0.62 (0.45-0.87), 0.59 (0.49-0.72) and 0.52 (0.36-0.75). Compared to chemotherapy alone, all differences were statistically significant. Subgroup analysis showed that only with the TP, Aidi injection could increase the ORR and DCR. Treatment with 100 ml, 80 ml or 50 ml/time, and 14 days/2 cycles or 21 days/2-4 cycles, Aidi injection could increase the ORR and DCR, respectively. Sensitivity analysis showed that the results had good robustness. None of the trials reported the overall survivals (OS), progression free survival (PFS). The quality of evidences was moderate. Conclusions: Current moderate evidence revealed that Aidi injection plus paclitaxel-based chemotherapy, especially TP can significantly improve the clinical efficacy and QOL for patients with stage III/IV NSCLC. Aidi injection can relieve the risk of hematotoxicity, gastrointestinal toxicity and liver injury in patient with NSCLC receiving paclitaxel-based chemotherapy. The optimal usage may be 50 ml/time and 14 days/2 cycles.","[Xiao, Zheng; Wang, Chengqiong; Zhou, Minghua; Jiang, Yuan; Chen, Ling] Zunyi Med Univ, Affiliated Hosp, Zunyi Med Coll,Evidence Based Med Ctr, MOE Virtual Res Ctr Evidence Based Med, Zunyi 563003, Guizhou, Peoples R China; [Xiao, Zheng; Wang, Chengqiong; Li, Nana; Chen, Ling] Zunyi Med Univ, Affiliated Hosp, Dept Resp Med, Ctr Evidence Based & Translat Med Major Infect Di, Zunyi 563003, Guizhou, Peoples R China; [Li, Xiaofei] Zunyi Med Univ, Special Key Lab Special Antitumor Drugs Guizhou P, Zunyi 563003, Guizhou, Peoples R China; [Feng, Jihong] Zunyi Med Univ, Affiliated Hosp, Dept Oncol, Zunyi 563003, Guizhou, Peoples R China; [Hu, Shanshan; Huang, Xiaorong] Zunyi Med Univ, Affiliated Hosp, GCP Ctr, Zunyi 563003, Guizhou, Peoples R China; [Tang, Fushan] Zunyi Med Univ, Sch Pharm, Zunyi 563003, Guizhou, Peoples R China; [Chen, Xiaofan] Jiangxi Univ Tradit Chinese Med, Evidence Based Med Res Ctr, Nanchang 330004, Jiangxi, Peoples R China; [Ding, Jie] Zunyi Med Univ, Affiliated Hosp, Outpatient Dept, Psychol Counseling Clin, Zunyi 563003, Guizhou, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yuhe] Zunyi Med Univ, Affiliated Hosp, Dept Pharm, Zunyi 563003, Guizhou, Peoples R China",Zunyi Medical University; Zunyi Medical University; Zunyi Medical University; Zunyi Medical University; Zunyi Medical University; Zunyi Medical University; Jiangxi University of Traditional Chinese Medicine; Zunyi Medical University; Zunyi Medical University,"Xiao, Z (corresponding author), Zunyi Med Univ, Affiliated Hosp, Zunyi Med Coll,Evidence Based Med Ctr, MOE Virtual Res Ctr Evidence Based Med, Zunyi 563003, Guizhou, Peoples R China.;Li, XF (corresponding author), Zunyi Med Univ, Special Key Lab Special Antitumor Drugs Guizhou P, Zunyi 563003, Guizhou, Peoples R China.",zy426f@163.com; wcqwylc@126.com; minghuawind@hotmail.com; hsjixu@163.com; dolljiang@163.com; zyfyjg2011@163.com; 252578718@qq.com; jh_f@163.com; fstang@zmc.edu.cn; xiaofanci122306@163.com; 157322581@qq.com; lingjuncd@163.com; 1149076068@qq.com; lixiaofei35@sohu.com,"Tang, Fushan/AAW-6654-2020; Li, xiaofei/GXF-7187-2022; Huang, Xiaorong/GVU-4903-2022; li, nana/KHX-9502-2024",,special funds for academic seedlings training and innovation at Zunyi Medical College [(2017) 5733-034]; Special Funds For Science and Technology Research of Traditional Chinese and National Medicine in Guizhou [QZYY 2017-084]; Joint Fund for Science and Technology of Guizhou Province Science and Technology Hall [(2016) 7485]; High Level Innovative Talent Program in Guizhou [fzc 120171001]; Doctoral Fund of Zunyi Medical College [F-617]; Science and Technology Bureau [(2016) 7485]; Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical College [(2016) 7485],special funds for academic seedlings training and innovation at Zunyi Medical College; Special Funds For Science and Technology Research of Traditional Chinese and National Medicine in Guizhou; Joint Fund for Science and Technology of Guizhou Province Science and Technology Hall; High Level Innovative Talent Program in Guizhou; Doctoral Fund of Zunyi Medical College; Science and Technology Bureau; Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical College,"This work was funded by special funds for academic seedlings training and innovation at Zunyi Medical College [Qian Kehe Pingtai Rencai No. (2017) 5733-034], Special Funds For Science and Technology Research of Traditional Chinese and National Medicine in Guizhou (No. QZYY 2017-084), Joint Fund for Science and Technology of Guizhou Province Science and Technology Hall, Science and Technology Bureau and Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical College [No. (2016) 7485], a High Level Innovative Talent Program in Guizhou (No. fzc 120171001) and Doctoral Fund of Zunyi Medical College (No. F-617).",,87,42,43,1,51,ELSEVIER IRELAND LTD,CLARE,"ELSEVIER HOUSE, BROOKVALE PLAZA, EAST PARK SHANNON, CO, CLARE, 00000, IRELAND",0378-8741,1872-7573,,J ETHNOPHARMACOL,J.

Methods: According to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement, a search was performed in PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) for eligible studies from inception to October 2018. Hazard ratios (HRs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (Cis) were used to assess the strength of association. All data were analyzed with statistical software Stata 12.0. Results: Based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, 28 retrospective cohort studies, assessing 38,786 samples, were further analyzed. Results showed that EPE was associated with higher BCR risk, according to both univariate analysis (pooled HR=1.69, 95% CI: 1.55-1.85, p<0.001) and multivariate analysis (pooled HR=1.27, 95% CI: 1.19-1.35, p<0.001). Subgroup analysis also showed significant results in different groups. Sensitivity analysis indicated that results were robust and steady. Moreover, no potential publication bias was found among included studies, according to univariate analysis (p-Egger's=0.399) and multivariate analysis (p-Egger's=0.718). Conclusion: Present results suggest that the presence of EPE is one of the strongest independent predictors of BCR in patients undergoing RP treatment. Further prospective, multi-centered, and large sample size cohort studies are warranted to confirm present findings.","[Jiang, Wei] Nantong Univ, Affiliated Hosp 5, Med Sch, Dept Urol,Taizhou Peoples Hosp, Taizhou 225300, Jiangsu, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Lijin; Wu, Bin; Zha, Zhenlei; Zhao, Hu; Feng, Yejun] Southeast Univ, Med Coll, Affiliated Jiangyin Hosp, Dept Urol, 163 Shoushan Rd, Jiangyin 214400, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Nantong University; Southeast University - China,"Zhang, LJ (corresponding author), Southeast Univ, Med Coll, Affiliated Jiangyin Hosp, Dept Urol, 163 Shoushan Rd, Jiangyin 214400, Jiangsu, Peoples R China.",stzlj913729553@163.com,"Zhang, Lijin/AAA-2025-2022",,,,,,52,0,0,0,4,E-CENTURY PUBLISHING CORP,MADISON,"40 WHITE OAKS LN, MADISON, WI 53711 USA",1940-5901,,,INT J CLIN EXP MED,Int.

Study Design and Setting: We searched PubMed to identify all systematic reviews published in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Review or the core clinical journals in 2015, one year before the PRISMA harms checklist was published. We randomly selected, in a 1:1 ratio, Cochrane and non-Cochrane systematic reviews assessing drug effects (including both efficacy and safety). We used the PRISMA harms checklist published in 2016 to assess the quality of reporting of drug safety information. Multivariable linear regression analyses were used to explore the association of six prespecified variables with more complete reporting of PRISMA harms items. Results: We included 120 systematic reviews, including 60 Cochrane and 60 non-Cochrane reviews. Scores on the PRISMA harms checklist (23 items) were low (median 4, [first, third quartile: 2, 6]), with no difference between Cochrane and non-Cochrane reviews (4.5 [2, 7] vs. 4 [2.5, 5]; P = 0.29). Among all eligible reviews, only one item (i.e., state conclusions in coherence with the review findings) was reported adequately (proportion of adherence 81.6%); proportion of reporting for other items ranged from 1.7% to 68.3%. The four essential reporting items from PRISMA harms checklist were also poorly complied (proportion of adherence ranged from 1.7% to 9.2%). Multivariable linear regression analyses found no significant associations between any study characteristic and reporting on the PRISMA harms, likely because of limited variability in scores across studies. Conclusions: The reporting of safety information was poor both for Cochrane and non-Cochrane drug systematic reviews predating PRISMA harms checklist. The findings suggested a strong need to use the PRISMA harms checklist for reporting safety among drug systematic reviews. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

However, the results are not consistent in reported original studies, as well as in published meta-analysis. This study aims to clarify the relationship between overweight/obesity and kidney cancer by an updated overall and dose-response meta-analysis. Methods: This meta-analysis was conducted in accordance with PRISMA guideline. Relevant studies were searched using PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases. The studies were limited to human cohort studies in English and Chinese language. Random-effect models and dose-response meta-analysis were used to synthesize the results. Subgroup analyses were also conducted based on the characteristics of participants. Results: Twenty-four cohort studies with 8,953,478 participants were included in our meta-analysis. Compared to the normal weight, the pooled RRs of kidney cancer was 1.35 (1.27-1.43) in overweight and 1.76 (1.61-1.91) in obese participants. An increased kidney cancer risk of 1.06 (1.05-1.06) for each 1kg/m(2) increase in BMI was showed in dose-response meta-analysis. No significant heterogeneity was found across studies with I-2 = 39.4% for overweight, and I-2 = 43.3% for obesity. Conclusion: The overall and dose-response meta-analysis suggested that overweight/obesity increases the risk of kidney cancer both in men and women.","[Liu, Xuezhen; Hou, Haifeng; Zhu, Kai; Wang, Qian; Liu, Huamin; Zhang, Qianqian; Ji, Long; Li, Dong] Taishan Med Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, 619 Changcheng Rd, Tai An 271016, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Sun, Qi] Tradit Chinese Med Hosp Taian, Tai An, Shandong, Peoples R China",Shandong First Medical University & Shandong Academy of Medical Sciences,"Ji, L; Li, D (corresponding author), Taishan Med Univ, Sch Publ Hlth, 619 Changcheng Rd, Tai An 271016, Shandong, Peoples R China.",lji@tsmc.edu.cn; tsmcdongli@163.com,"Zhang, Qianqian/GXA-0841-2022","Wang, Qian/0000-0002-5031-0686; Hou, Haifeng/0000-0002-1131-1619",,,,,53,54,57,1,5,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",0025-7974,1536-5964,,MEDICINE,Medicine (Baltimore),NOV,2018,97,44,,,,,,,e12860,10.1097/MD.0000000000012860,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/MD.0000000000012860,,,13,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),General & Internal Medicine,HD3UC,30383638,"Green Published, gold",,,2024-11-25,WOS:000452445900016,View Full Record in Web of Science

The role of the technical choices to study calcareous biominerals is evidenced, showing that a single analysis is not enough to decipher complex biominerals.","[Dauphin, Yannicke] Sorbonne Univ, MNHN, Inst Systemat Evolut Biodiversite ISYEB, UMR 7205,CNRS, F-75005 Paris, France; [Brunelle, Alain] Univ Paris Sud, Univ Paris Saclay, CNRS UPR 2301, Inst Chim Subst Nat, Ave Terrasse, F-91192 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Medjoubi, Kadda; Somogyi, Andrea] Synchrotron Soleil, Nanoscopium Beamline, F-91192 Gif Sur Yvette, France; [Cuif, Jean-Pierre] Sorbonne Univ, CNRS, Museum Natl Hist Nat, CR2P,UMR 7207, F-75005 Paris, France",Sorbonne Universite; Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle (MNHN); Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); Universite Paris Saclay; Universite Paris Cite; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Chemistry (INC); SOLEIL Synchrotron; Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); CNRS - Institute of Ecology & Environment (INEE); Sorbonne Universite; Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle (MNHN),"Dauphin, Y (corresponding author), Sorbonne Univ, MNHN, Inst Systemat Evolut Biodiversite ISYEB, UMR 7205,CNRS, F-75005 Paris, France.",yannicke.dauphin@upmc.fr; alain.brunelle@cnrs.fr; kadda.medjoubi@synchrotron-soleil.fr; andrea.somogyi@synchrotron-soleil.fr; jean-pierre.cuif@orange.fr,"somogyi, andrea/F-7906-2015; Brunelle, Alain/L-3889-2013","somogyi, andrea/0000-0002-3814-4152; Brunelle, Alain/0000-0001-6526-6481","ESRF [CH721, CH948, CH1569, EC24]; ESF under the EUROCORES Programme EuroMinSci (BioCalc project) [European Commission, DG Research, FP6] [ERAS-CT-2003980409]; ANR [ANR-06-BLAN-0233]; SOLEIL grant [20170784]; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR) [ANR-06-BLAN-0233] Funding Source: Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)","ESRF; ESF under the EUROCORES Programme EuroMinSci (BioCalc project) [European Commission, DG Research, FP6]; ANR(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)); SOLEIL grant; Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR)(Agence Nationale de la Recherche (ANR))","This research was funded by ESRF grant number [CH721, CH948, CH1569, EC24], by ESF under the EUROCORES Programme EuroMinSci (BioCalc project) [ERAS-CT-2003980409 of the European Commission, DG Research, FP6], and ANR [ANR-06-BLAN-0233], and a SOLEIL grant (20170784).",,43,6,6,0,2,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",2075-163X,,,MINERALS-BASEL,Minerals,SEP,2018,8,9,,,,,,,365,10.3390/min8090365,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/min8090365,,,19,Geochemistry & Geophysics; Mineralogy; Mining & Mineral Processing,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Geochemistry & Geophysics; Mineralogy; Mining & Mineral Processing,GX7HX,,"gold, Green Published, Green Submitted",,,2024-11-25,WOS:000447939100005,View Full Record in Web of Science

It is made from an extraction of Mylabris Phalerata, Radix Astragalus, Radix Ginseng, and Acanthopanax Senticosus. Aim of the study: The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Aidi injection in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy for stage IIIB/IV NSCLC. Materials and methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed following the PRISMA (the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. Trials were combined using Review Manager 5.3 and Comprehensive Meta-Analysis(CMA) 2.0. Dichotomous data were expressed as risk ratio (RR) and continuous outcomes as weighted mean difference (WMD), with their 95% confidence intervals (CI) respectively. All randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing Aidi injection plus platinum-based chemotherapy versus platinum-based chemotherapy, with efficacy and safety outcomes were selected. Disease Control Rate (DCR) was the primary outcome, Objective Response Rate (ORR), survival rate, quality of life (QOL), and toxic effects were the secondary outcomes. Results: 42 RCTs recruiting 4081 patients with stage IIIB/IV NSCLC were included, with overall low-moderate methodological quality. Compared with platinum-based chemotherapy alone, Aidi injection plus platinum-based chemotherapy can increase relative benefit of DCR (RR = 1.13, 95% CI 1.09-1.16, P < 0.00001), ORR (RR = 1.26, 95% CI 1.18-1.36, P < 0.00001), improve 1-, 2-, 3-year survival rates (RR = 1.14, 95% CI 1.02-1.28, P = 0.03; RR = 1.31, 95% CI 1.05-1.64, P = 0.02; and RR = 1.88, 95% CI 1.32-2.67, P = 0.0005, respectively), QOL (RR = 1.80, 95% CI 1.61-2.01, P < 0.00001), and reduce severe (grade 3 and 4) toxicities by 36% (RR = 0.64, 95% CI 0.58-0.70, P < 0.00001). Conclusions: From the available evidence, compared with platinum-based chemotherapy alone, Aidi injection plus platinum-based chemotherapy improves the clinical efficacy and alleviates the toxicity of chemotherapy in patients with stage IIIB/IV NSCLC. However, considering the intrinsic limitations of the included RCTs, well designed, rigorously performed, high-quality trials are still required to further assess and confirm the results.","[Wang, Jue; Yu, Lili; Wu, Qibiao] Macau Univ Sci & Technol, State Key Lab Qual Res Chinese Med, Macau, Peoples R China; [Wang, Jue; Yu, Lili; Mo, Tingting; Wu, Qibiao; Zhou, Zhou] Macau Univ Sci & Technol, Fac Chinese Med, Macau, Peoples R China; [Li, Guochun] Nanjing Univ Chinese Med, Sch Med & Life Sci, Nanjing, Jiangsu, Peoples R China",Macau University of Science & Technology; Macau University of Science & Technology; Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine,"Wu, QB (corresponding author), Macau Univ Sci & Technol, State Key Lab Qual Res Chinese Med, Macau, Peoples R China.",wangjue2014must@gmail.com; Dr.Guochun_li@njucm.edu.cn; llyu@must.edu.mo; motingting1985@hotmail.com; qbwu@must.edu.mo; zhouzhou0512@126.com,"LI, Guo-chun/D-5152-2015; QIBIAO, WU/AAA-7621-2019","WANG, JUE/0000-0002-6151-1117; Wu, Qibiao/0000-0002-1670-1050","Science and Technology Development Fund, Macau SAR [007/2013/A, 130/2017/A3]","Science and Technology Development Fund, Macau SAR","This study was funded by the Science and Technology Development Fund, Macau SAR (007/2013/A, 130/2017/A3).",,94,48,50,0,43,ELSEVIER IRELAND LTD,CLARE,"ELSEVIER HOUSE, BROOKVALE PLAZA, EAST PARK SHANNON, CO, CLARE, 00000, IRELAND",0378-8741,1872-7573,,J ETHNOPHARMACOL,J.

Engineering authorities guide the codes for a novel concept design such as a prismatic pressure vessel using a design by analysis (DBA). DBA methods enable high efficiency because they directly calculate the loads to avoid inherent conservativeness that exists in a design by rule (DBR). However, in DBA methods, the designer should conduct a finite element analysis (FEA) and evaluate the results iteratively to meet the design criteria. In this paper, we propose a new approach to estimating the minimum vapor pressure of a prismatic pressure vessel that follows the design philosophy of an IMO Type C independent tank. The procedure of the proposed method was demonstrated based on a case study. An FEA was also conducted for verification purposes. The results show that the proposed method can effectively estimate the required minimum shell thickness and designed vapor pressure without conducting an iterative FEA. In addition, minimization of the tank shell thickness is made possible because the proposed method directly calculates the crack propagation rate to avoid an unnecessary margin while satisfying the fatigue crack propagation criteria.","[Lee, Jaemin; Chang, Daejun] Korea Adv Inst Sci & Technol, Dept Mech Engn, Daejeon, South Korea; [Jo, Choonghee] LATTICE Technol, 291 Daehak Ro, Daejeon 34141, South Korea; [Chung, Hyun] Chungnam Natl Univ, Dept Naval Architecture & Ocean Engn, 99 Daehak Ro, Daejeon 34134, South Korea",Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology (KAIST); Chungnam National University,"Chung, H (corresponding author), Chungnam Natl Univ, Dept Naval Architecture & Ocean Engn, 99 Daehak Ro, Daejeon 34134, South Korea.",hchung@cnu.ac.kr,"Chung, Hyun/C-1726-2011; Chang, DaeJun/C-1791-2011","Lee, Jaemin/0000-0002-1781-4380; Chung, Hyun/0000-0001-9749-8666","Industrial Strategic Technology Development Program - Ministry of Trade, Industry & Energy, Republic of Korea [10045012]","Industrial Strategic Technology Development Program - Ministry of Trade, Industry & Energy, Republic of Korea","This work was supported by the Industrial Strategic Technology Development Program (10045012, the design core technology development of LNG Ship-to-Ship Bunkering Shuttle), which was funded by the Ministry of Trade, Industry & Energy, Republic of Korea (10045012).",,22,4,5,1,11,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,OXFORD,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",0029-8018,1873-5258,,OCEAN ENG,Ocean Eng.,JUN 15,2018,158,,,,,,367,377,,10.1016/j.oceaneng.2018.04.008,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.oceaneng.2018.04.008,,,11,"Engineering, Marine; Engineering, Civil; Engineering, Ocean; Oceanography",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Engineering; Oceanography,GH7RD,,,,,2024-11-25,WOS:000433650200029,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, few authors have contributed to the problems of safety in pure linear motion, i.e. a prismatic joint, in contrast to rotary motion. The contribution of this work is to present a new design that is capable of achieving, passively, an implementation of nonlinear elastic behavior for prismatic joints the so-called Prismatic Compliant Joint (PCJ). This new device is based on the association of a six-bar mechanism with a linear spring. Hence, this structure generates a nonlinear stiffness behavior under a specified external force. The elastic characteristics of the PCJ are derived from a generic biological muscle mechanical behavior model and then customized according to the force-safety criteria of physical Human/Robot Interaction (pHRI) into a Hunt-Crossley contact model. A further investigation is carried out, via simulation, to verify the shock absorption capacity of the PCJ with a dummy head obstacle. In order to fit the PCJ response curve to the established safety measures, an optimization based on a genetic algorithm method is employed to tune the PCJ's intrinsic parameters subject to some chosen constraints.

However, the results were inconsistent. The aim of this meta-analysis was to elucidate whether BRCA2 N372H polymorphism was associated with cancer risk. Methods: We identified eligible studies, published from 2000 through 2016, by searching PubMed, Web of knowledge and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI). Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were used to assess the strength of association between BRCA2 N372H polymorphism and cancer risk. Heterogeneity among studies was evaluated using Cochran's Q and I2 statistics. Results: A total of forty six case-control studies were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled analysis indicated that BRCA2 N372H polymorphism was significantly associated with an increased risk of overall cancer (dominant model: OR = 1.06, 95% CI = 1.01-1.12; recessive model: OR = 1.13, 95% CI = 1.03-1.17). In subgroup analysis, we also found significantly increased risk of BRCA2 N372H polymorphism with ovarian cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, population-based controls and Africans. Conclusions: This research study showed a major role of polymorphism in shaping over cancer risk. Future large-scale studies performed in multiple populations are warranted to confirm the results.","[Yan, Li-Hui] China Med Univ, Liaoning Canc Hosp & Inst, Canc Hosp, Dept Anesthesiol, Shenyang, Liaoning, Peoples R China; [Wang, Yue] China Med Univ, Liaoning Canc Hosp & Inst, Canc Hosp, Dept Gen Surg, 44 Xiaoheyan Rd, Shenyang 110042, Liaoning, Peoples R China; [Sun, Feng-Hua] Xiamen Univ, Dept Anesthesiol, Affiliated Hosp 1, Xiamen, Fujian, Peoples R China; [Yang, Helen] Univ Calif San Francisco, Inst Publ Hlth, San Francisco, CA 94143 USA",China Medical University; China Medical University; Xiamen University; Public Health Institute; University of California System; University of California San Francisco,"Wang, Y (corresponding author), China Med Univ, Liaoning Canc Hosp & Inst, Canc Hosp, Dept Gen Surg, 44 Xiaoheyan Rd, Shenyang 110042, Liaoning, Peoples R China.",13514212975@163.com,,,"PhD Start-up Fund of Liaoning Province, China [201601413]; Liaoning BaiQian-Wan Talents Program, type C project [13]; Natural Science Foundation of Liaoning Province of China","PhD Start-up Fund of Liaoning Province, China; Liaoning BaiQian-Wan Talents Program, type C project; Natural Science Foundation of Liaoning Province of China(Natural Science Foundation of Liaoning Province)","The research was supported by the grants from The PhD Start-up Fund of Liaoning Province, China (No. 201601413) and Liaoning BaiQian-Wan Talents Program, type C project, No. 13 and Natural Science Foundation of Liaoning Province of China.",,22,1,1,0,1,E-CENTURY PUBLISHING CORP,MADISON,"40 WHITE OAKS LN, MADISON, WI 53711 USA",1940-5901,,,INT J CLIN EXP MED,Int.

Studies of ophthalmology may present additional challenges because of their potentially complex study designs. The aim of this study was to evaluate the reporting quality of systematic reviews and meta-analyses on topics in ophthalmology to determine compliance with the PRISMA guidelines. We assessed articles published between 2010 and 2015 in the five major relevant journals with the highest impact factors. Methods: The MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched to identify systematic reviews published between January 2010 and December 2015 in the following 5 major ophthalmology journals: Progress in Retinal and Eye Research, Ophthalmology, Archives of Ophthalmology, American Journal of Ophthalmology, and Survey of Ophthalmology. The screening, identification, and scoring of articles were independently performed by two teams, and the results were submitted to statistical analysis to determine medians, ranges, and 95% CIs. Results: A total of 115 articles were included. The median compliance was 15 out of 27 items (56%), the range was 5-26 (26-96%), and the inter-quartile range was 10 (37%). Compliance was highest in items related to the 'description of rationale' (item 3, 100%) and sequentially lower in 'the general interpretation of results' (item 26, 96%) and 'the inclusion of a structured summary in the abstract' (item 2, 90%). Compliance was poorest in the items 'indication of review protocol and registration' (item 5, 9%), 'specification of risk of biases that may affect the cumulative evidence' (item 15, 24%), and 'description of clear objectives in the introduction' (item 4, 26%). Conclusion: The reporting quality of systematic reviews and meta-analyses in ophthalmology should be significantly improved. While we recommend the use of the PRISMA criteria as a guideline before journal submission, additional research aimed at identifying potential barriers to compliance may be required to improve compliance with PRISMA guidelines.","[Lee, Seon-Young] Trent NHS Fdn Trust, Nottingham Univ Hosp, Nottingham, England; [Sagoo, Harkiran] Guys Kings & St Thomas Sch Med Educ, London, England; [Farwana, Reem] Univ Birmingham, Birmingham, W Midlands, England; [Whitehurst, Katharine] UCL, London, England; [Fowler, Alex] Guys & St Thomas NHS Fdn Trust, London, England; [Agha, Riaz] Univ Oxford, Guys & St Thomas NHS Fdn Trust, Oxford, England; [Agha, Riaz] Univ Oxford, Balliol Coll, Oxford, England",University of Nottingham; Nottingham University Hospital NHS Trust; University of Birmingham; University of London; University College London; Guy's & St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust; University of Oxford; University of Oxford,"Lee, SY (corresponding author), Trent NHS Fdn Trust, Nottingham Univ Hosp, Nottingham, England.",seon.lee@nhs.net,"Agha, Riaz/KLC-2726-2024","Farwana, Reem/0000-0002-4700-7723",,,,,24,9,10,0,10,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,1471-2288,,BMC MED RES METHODOL,BMC Med.

A functional locus rs143383 of bone morphogenetic protein-14 (BMP-14) has been pointed out to be associated with OA etiology, but conflicting conclusions have been reached. To provide a more comprehensive conclusion about this issue, we performed this meta-analysis.Methods:Relevant studies were searched from electronic databases including PubMed, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, Embase, and Wanfang. The strength of correlations was examined with pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). Subgroup analyses stratified by ethnicity and source of control were carried out. All statistical analyses were performed with STATA software (version 12.0).Results:Overall, BMP-14 rs143383 polymorphism was negatively correlated with the susceptibility to knee OA and hand OA under genetic contrasts of CC versus TT, CC+TC versus TT, CC versus TT+TC, C versus T, TC versus TT (OR=0.71, 95% CI=0.65-0.79; OR=0.81, 95% CI=0.73-0.89; OR=0.79, 95% CI=0.71-0.86; OR=0.85, 95% CI=0.81-0.90; OR=0.84, 95% CI=0.75-0.93), and TC versus TT, CC versus TT+TC, C versus T (OR=0.76, 95% CI=0.65-0.89; OR=0.79, 95% CI=0.68-0.92; OR=0.90, 95% CI=0.85-0.95), respectively; similar results were observed in subgroups after stratification analyses. Additionally, the polymorphism also reduced hip OA risk in Asian group after stratified analysis by ethnicity.Conclusion:BMP-14 rs143383 polymorphism may be a protective factor against OA occurrence.","[Yin, Yi; Wang, Yan] Chinese Peoples Liberat Army Gen Hosp, Dept Orthopaed, Beijing 100853, Peoples R China",Chinese People's Liberation Army General Hospital,"Wang, Y (corresponding author), Chinese Peoples Liberat Army Gen Hosp, Dept Orthopaed, Beijing 100853, Peoples R China.",qukai521314@126.com,,,,,,,38,10,11,0,4,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",0025-7974,1536-5964,,MEDICINE,Medicine (Baltimore),OCT,2017,96,42,,,,,,,e7447,10.1097/MD.0000000000007447,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/MD.0000000000007447,,,7,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),General & Internal Medicine,FM5SO,29049177,"Green Published, gold",,,2024-11-25,WOS:000415100000015,View Full Record in Web of Science

Blood pressure (BP) deviation at rest is well defined and accompanies risk for cardiovascular events and cardiovascular mortality. A growing body of evidence emphasises that an exaggerated blood pressure response (EBPR) in cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) could help to identify seemingly cardiovascular healthy and normotensive subjects, who have an increased risk of developing aHT and cardiovascular events in the future. Materials and methods: The PubMed online database was searched for published studies reporting exercise-related BP and both the risk of aHT and cardiovascular events in the future. Results: We identified 18 original studies about EBPR in CPET, which included a total of 35,151 normotensive individuals for prediction of new onset of aHT in the future and 11 original studies with 43,012 enrolled subjects with the endpoint of cardiovascular events in the future. Although an EBPR under CPET is not well defined, a large number of studies emphasise that EBPR in CPET is associated with both new-onset aHT and cardiovascular events in the future. Conclusions: A growing number of studies support the hypothesis that EBPR in CPET may be a diagnostic tool to identify subjects with an elevated risk of developing aHT and cardiovascular events in the future.

XRCC1 is one of important molecular markers for BER. So far, the role of XRCC1 polymorphisms with clinical outcomes of advanced NSCLC treated with platinum-based chemotherapy is inconclusive. To explore the relationship between XRCC1 polymorphisms and platinum-based chemotherapy in advanced NSCLC patients, we performed this meta-analysis. Methods: Crude odds ratios (ORs), Cox proportional hazard ratios (HRs) with the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were adopted to assess the strength of association between XRCC1 polymorphisms and response rate, Overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS) of advanced NSCLC treated with platinum-based chemotherapy. Q test and I-2 test were used for the assessment of heterogeneity. Subgroup analyses were conducted when heterogeneity exists. Begg's funnel plots and Egger's linear regression test were used to estimate publication bias. Sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the stability of the result. Results: A total of 19 studies including 2815 individuals were eligible for the analysis, results showed XRCC1 194Arg allele was negatively associated with the objective response rate relative to 194Trp, and results of homozygous model, dominant model and heterozygous model suggested a gene dosage effect negative correlation between 194Arg allele and objective response rate(ArgArg vs TrpTrp: OR = 0.64(95% CI: 0.44-0.91); ArgArg + TrpArg vs TrpTrp: OR = 0.79(95% CI: 0.57-1.11); TrpArg vs TrpTrp: OR = 1.05(95% CI: 0.73-1.51)). XRCC1 399Gln may indicate favorable overall survival (GlnGln + GlnArg vs ArgArg: HR = 0.65(95% CI: 0.43-0.98)) and favorable PFS (GlnGln vs ArgArg: HR = 0. 72(95% CI: 0.48-0.97)) in Asian patients; while in Caucasian patients, XRCC1 399Gln indicated poorer overall survival (GlnGln vs ArgArg: HR = 2.29(95% CI: 1.25-3.33)). Conclusions: Our results indicated that in NSCLC patients treated with platinum-based regimen, XRCC1 194Arg allele suggest poor objective response rate, the GlnGln genotype of XRCC1 399 suggest poorer overall survival in Caucasian patients, and longer PFS in Asian patients.","[Li, Dan-Juan] Southern Med Univ, Nanfang Hosp, Dept Oncol, Guangzhou 510515, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Xiao, Dong] Southern Med Univ, Canc Res Inst, Guangzhou 510515, Guangdong, Peoples R China",Southern Medical University - China; Southern Medical University - China,"Li, DJ (corresponding author), Southern Med Univ, Nanfang Hosp, Dept Oncol, Guangzhou 510515, Guangdong, Peoples R China.",miamili@foxmail.com,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [81101535]; Special Foundation for National Clinical Specialties of China,National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)(National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)); Special Foundation for National Clinical Specialties of China,"This study funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC, GrantNo. 81101535) and the Special Foundation for National Clinical Specialties of China (to Department of Oncology, Nanfang Hospital).

However, the prognostic values of GSTP1, p16, ESR1, and PITX2 promoter methylation in breast cancer remain to be determined. Here, we performed this study to evaluate the prognostic significance of GSTP1, p16, ESR1, and PITX2 promoter methylation in breast cancer. Methods: A range of online databases was systematically searched to identify available studies based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline. The pooled hazard ratios (HRs) with their 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were applied to estimate the prognostic effect of GSTP1, p16, ESR1, and PITX2 promoter methylation in breast cancer for multivariate regression analysis. Results: 13 eligible articles involving 3915 patients with breast cancer were analyzed in this meta-analysis. In a large patient population, GSTP1 showed a trend toward a worse prognosis in overall survival (OS) (HR=1.64, 95% CI=0.93-2.87, P=.085). PITX2 promoter methylation was significantly correlated with a worse prognosis in OS (HR=1.57,95% CI=1.15-2.14, P=.004), but no association between p16 promoter methylation and OS (HR= 0.92, 95% CI=0.31-2.71, P=.884). PITX2 promoter methylation was significantly correlated with an unfavorable prognosis of patients with breast cancer in metastasis-free survival (MFS) (HR=1.73, 95% CI=1.33-2.26, P<.001). The result from 3 studies with 227 cases showed that ESR1 promoter methylation was linked to a worse prognosis in OS (HR=1.55, 95% CI=1.06-2.28,P=.025). Conclusions: Our findings suggest ESR1 and PITX2 promoter methylation may be correlated with a worse survival of patients with breast cancer (ESR1: OS, PITX2: OS and MFS). The clinical utility of aberrantly methylated ESR1 and PITX2 could be a promising factor for the prognosis of breast cancer.","[Sheng, Xianneng; Guo, Yu] Ningbo Univ, Dept Thyroid & Breast Surg, Ningbo Hosp 1, Ningbo, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Lu, Yang] Ningbo Univ, Med Sch, Ningbo, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Ningbo University; Ningbo University,"Sheng, XN; Guo, Y (corresponding author), Ningbo Univ, Dept Thyroid & Breast Surg, Ningbo Hosp 1, Ningbo, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",bbwsdd@126.com; guoyu308@163.com,,,,,,,52,18,18,0,11,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",0025-7974,1536-5964,,MEDICINE,Medicine (Baltimore),JUL,2017,96,28,,,,,,,e7476,10.1097/MD.0000000000007476,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/MD.0000000000007476,,,7,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),General & Internal Medicine,FA7VT,28700487,"Green Published, gold",,,2024-11-25,WOS:000405656000025,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, the prognostic and predictive role of P16 expression after neoadjuvant chemotherapy remains unclear. We first determined whether P16 expression can become a potential prognostic and predictive biomarker in high-grade osteosarcoma. Methods: This meta-analysis was conducted based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline. Eligible studies were pooled and the overall odds ratios (ORs) and hazard ratios (HRs) with the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated in this analysis. Results: Four studies involving a total of 527 patients with high-grade osteosarcoma receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy were identified. We did not find that P16 expression was correlated with sex status, histologic subtype, and tumor site (P > .1). P16 expression was found to be significantly associated with a good response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (OR = 4.69, P < .001). A significant relationship was observed between p16 expression and pathologic complete response after neoadjuvant chemotherapy using multivariate analysis (OR = 9.63, P = .001). The expression of the P16 was not associated with clinical outcomes in overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) by multivariate analysis (OS: P = .448; DFS: P = .263). Conclusions: The use of P16 expression could become a promising predictive biomarker of the response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in the white population with high-grade osteosarcoma. However, it was not correlated with the prognosis of patients in OS and DFS. More clinical researches are very essential in Asians in the future.","[Tang, Yin; Yang, Changchun; Guo, Zonghui; Fu, Youwei; Yu, Xiao; Liu, Binggen; Zhou, Haier; Wang, Junjie; Li, Weilong; Pang, Qingjiang] Ningbo 2 Hosp, Dept Orthoped Ctr, Ningbo 315000, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",,"Tang, Y; Pang, QJ (corresponding author), Ningbo 2 Hosp, Dept Orthoped Ctr, Ningbo 315000, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",zhejiangdaxuety@163.com; pqjey@sina.com,,,"Natural Science Foundation of Ningbo, China [2014A610254]; Key Program of Clinical Specialty Disciplines of Ningbo, China [2013-88]; Key Program of Medical Disciplines of Ningbo, China [2016-55]; Program of Medical Science and Technology of Ningbo, China [2016A49]","Natural Science Foundation of Ningbo, China; Key Program of Clinical Specialty Disciplines of Ningbo, China; Key Program of Medical Disciplines of Ningbo, China; Program of Medical Science and Technology of Ningbo, China","This research was supported by grants from Natural Science Foundation of Ningbo, China (No. 2014A610254), Key Program of Clinical Specialty Disciplines of Ningbo, China (No. 2013-88), Key Program of Medical Disciplines of Ningbo, China (No. 2016-55) and Program of Medical Science and Technology of Ningbo, China (No. 2016A49).",,38,11,14,0,3,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",0025-7974,1536-5964,,MEDICINE,Medicine (Baltimore),MAY,2017,96,19,,,,,,,e6714,10.1097/MD.0000000000006714,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/MD.0000000000006714,,,7,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),General & Internal Medicine,EU7BB,28489748,"gold, Green Published",,,2024-11-25,WOS:000401188600015,View Full Record in Web of Science

APC promoter methylation was shown to be associated with hepatitis B virus (HBV), and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection status of patients with HCC (OR =2.86, P=0.005; OR =3.50, P=0.001; respectively), but not correlated with clinical stage, gender, and vascular invasion status (P>0.1). Conclusions: APC promoter methylation may be correlated with HCC, especially for patients with HBV and HCV infection status. Promoter methylation of the APC may be a potential noninvasive biomarker using blood samples in the detection of HCC. More studies with large samples sizes are needed to validate our findings in the future.","[Zhang, Yaqiong; Wu, Xiaoyu; Chen, Qi; Li, Zhaoyun] Taizhou Cent Hosp, Dept Clin Lab, Taizhou 318000, Peoples R China; [Li, Bo] Taizhou Hosp, Ultrasound Dept, Taizhou 318000, Peoples R China; [Sun, Qianqian; Mo, Jinggang] Wenzhou Med Univ, Sch Life Sci, Wenzhou 325000, Peoples R China",Taizhou University; Wenzhou Medical University,"Li, ZY (corresponding author), Taizhou Cent Hosp, Dept Clin Lab, Taizhou 318000, Peoples R China.;Mo, JG (corresponding author), Wenzhou Med Univ, Affiliated Hosp 1, Wenzhou 325000, Peoples R China.",kyyx111111@163.co; ayaya0305@163.com,"wu, 晓煜/HIK-3475-2022; Sun, Qianqian/KVY-2334-2024",,Health & Medical Science and Technology Program of Zhejiang Province [2017171691],Health & Medical Science and Technology Program of Zhejiang Province,The research was supported by grants from the Health & Medical Science and Technology Program of Zhejiang Province (2017171691).,,56,0,0,0,2,AME PUBLISHING COMPANY,SHATIN,"FLAT-RM C 16F, KINGS WING PLAZA 1, NO 3 KWAN ST, SHATIN, HONG KONG 00000, PEOPLES R CHINA",2218-676X,2219-6803,,TRANSL CANCER RES,Transl.

This study was first determined to evaluate the clinical effects of p53 expression in SCC of the sinonasal tract. Methods: According to the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement criteria, the potential literature was searched from diverse databases. The pooled odds ratios (ORs) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to assess the strength of association between p53 expression and SNSCC. Results: Final 17 eligible studies were included in a total of 258 cases and 748 controls. The result of p53 expression was shown to be notably higher in SNSCC than in benign sinonasal papillomas and normal sinonasal mucosa (OR=26.93, P< 0.001; OR= 39.79, P< 0.001; respectively). Subgroup analyses of ethnicity revealed that p53 expression had significant association with SNSCC in Asian and Caucasian populations in cancer versus benign sinonasal papillomas or normal sinonasal mucosa. The expression of p53 was notably higher in moderately or poorly differentiated SNSCC than in well-differentiated SNSCC (OR= 3.51, P= 0.021), while p53 expression was not associated with histological type. Conclusion: The results suggested that p53 overexpression may be correlated with the carcinogenesis and progression of SNSCC. The p53 gene may become a novel drug target of SNSCC. Additional studies on the correlation of p53 expression with clinicopathological features are needed.","[Wang, Xiaowei; Lv, Wei; Qi, Fang; Gao, Zhiqiang; Yang, Hua; Wang, Weiqing; Gao, Yali] Chinese Acad Med Sci, Peking Union Med Coll Hosp, Peking Union Med Coll, Dept ENT, 1 Shuaifuyuan, Beijing 100730, Peoples R China",Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences - Peking Union Medical College; Peking Union Medical College Hospital; Peking Union Medical College,"Lv, W; Qi, F (corresponding author), Chinese Acad Med Sci, Peking Union Med Coll Hosp, Peking Union Med Coll, Dept ENT, 1 Shuaifuyuan, Beijing 100730, Peoples R China.",lili20020615@sina.com; qifangent@qq.com,"Gao, Yali/AAQ-7570-2020; yu, yang/HIZ-9682-2022","lv, wei/0000-0003-0127-8824; Wang, Weiqing/0000-0002-9440-1117",,,,,42,8,9,2,3,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",0025-7974,1536-5964,,MEDICINE,Medicine (Baltimore),MAR,2017,96,12,,,,,,,e6424,10.1097/MD.0000000000006424,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/MD.0000000000006424,,,8,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),General & Internal Medicine,EP8IT,28328848,"Green Published, gold",,,2024-11-25,WOS:000397619800051,View Full Record in Web of Science

Previous studies evaluated published SRs and determined that they failed to meet explicit criteria or characteristics. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement was recommended as a reporting guideline for SR and meta-analysis (MA), but previous studies showed that adherence to the statement was not high for SRs published in different medical fields. Thus, the aims of this study are twofold: (1) to investigate the number of nursing journals that have required or recommended the use of the PRISMA statement for reporting SR, and (2) to examine the adherence of SRs and/or meta-analyses to the PRISMA statement published in nursing journals. Design: A cross-sectional study. Methods: Nursing journals listed in the ISI journal citation report were divided into 2 groups based on the recommendation of PRISMA statement in their 'Instruction for Authors'. SRs and meta-analyses published in 2014 were searched in 3 databases. 37 SRs and meta-analyses were randomly selected in each group. The adherence of each item to the PRISMA was examined and summarised using descriptive statistics. The quality of the SRs was assessed by Assessing the Methodological Quality of Systematic Reviews. The differences between the 2 groups were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test. Results: Out of 107 nursing journals, 30 (28.0%) recommended or required authors to follow the PRISMA statement when they submit SRs or meta-analyses. The median rates of adherence to the PRISMA statement for reviews published in journals with and without PRISMA endorsement were 64.9% (IQR: 17.6-92.3%) and 73.0% (IQR: 59.5-94.6%), respectively. No significant difference was observed in any of the items between the 2 groups. Conclusions: The median adherence of SRs and meta-analyses in nursing journals to PRISMA is low at 64.9% and 73.0%, respectively. Nonetheless, the adherence level of nursing journals to the PRISMA statement does not significantly vary whether they endorse or recommend such a guideline.","[Tam, Wilson W.

Firstly, the relevant theoretical background is summarized, closely following the theoretical derivation performed by Szalai and Papp (2010). Secondly, the required transformations for the engineering application of the design procedure are detailed and extended to arbitrary bending moment distributions. Appropriate generalized initial imperfection factors for the out-of-plane buckling of beam-columns are defined so as to achieving complete consistency across the stability verifications for columns, beams and beam-columns. The proposed procedure is subsequently validated against a large set of advanced numerical simulations. A good agreement was found between the numerical results and the estimates provided by the proposed design procedure, both in terms of the overall trend and the specific quantitative results. Based on a statistical assessment, the comparison with the interaction expression of Eurocode 3 (2005) (method 2) showed that this proposal slightly outperforms the Eurocode procedure, both in terms of average values and dispersion of results.

However, the role of CDH13 promoter methylation status in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) remains to be clarified. Methods: Eligible articles were identified from online electronic database based on the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement criteria. The pooled odds ratio (OR) and the corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were calculated and analyzed. Results: Eventually, a total of nine studies were included in this meta-analysis, including 488 CRC, 298 adjacent, 144 normal, 68 premalignant tissues. The results demonstrated that CDH13 promoter methylation was notably higher in CRC than in normal, adjacent, and premalignant tissues (cancer tissues vs normal tissues: OR= 16.94, P< 0.001; cancer tissues vs adjacent tissues: OR= 20.06, P< 0.001; cancer tissues vs premalignant tissues: OR= 2.23, P= 0.038). CDH13 promoter methylation had a significantly increased risk for poorly differentiated CRC (OR= 4.07, P= 0.001). CDH13 promoter methylation was not associated with sex status, tumor stage, and lymph node status (all P> 0.05). One study with 85 CRC patients reported that CDH13 promoter methylation was correlated with poor prognosis in overall survival (OS). Conclusions: CDH13 promoter methylation may play an important role in the initiation and progression of CRC, and may be correlated with OS of patients with CRC. Additional studies with large sample sizes are needed to further confirm our findings in the future.","[Ye, Meng; Huang, Tao; Li, Jinyun; Yang, Ping; Ni, Chao; Chen, Si] Ningbo Univ, Affiliated Hosp, Ningbo 315020, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Zhou, Chongchang; Yang, Ping; Ni, Chao] Ningbo Univ, Sch Med, Zhejiang Prov Key Lab Pathophysiol, Ningbo, Zhejiang, Peoples R China",Ningbo University; Ningbo University,"Ye, M; Huang, T (corresponding author), Ningbo Univ, Affiliated Hosp, Ningbo 315020, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.",yemeng@nbu.edu.cn; huangtao433@163.com,"Huang, Tao/L-8505-2019","Zhou, Chongchang/0000-0002-8728-6819",Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province [LY16H160005]; Ningbo Natural Science Foundation [2014A610235]; Project of Scientific Innovation Team of Ningbo [2015B11050],Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province(Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province); Ningbo Natural Science Foundation; Project of Scientific Innovation Team of Ningbo,"The research was supported by the grants from Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province (LY16H160005), Ningbo Natural Science Foundation (2014A610235), and Project of Scientific Innovation Team of Ningbo (2015B11050).",,28,21,24,1,4,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",0025-7974,1536-5964,,MEDICINE,Medicine (Baltimore),JAN,2017,96,4,,,,,,,e5956,10.1097/MD.0000000000005956,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/MD.0000000000005956,,,6,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),General & Internal Medicine,EK1WT,28121942,"Green Published, gold",,,2024-11-25,WOS:000393717200032,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, the clinical significance of CDH gene methylation in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear. Methods: Based on the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement criteria, available studies were identified from online electronic database. The overall odds ratio (OR) and the corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were calculated and analyzed. Results: A total of 29 eligible studies with 2562 HCC samples and 1685 controls were included. E-cadherin (CDH1) hypermethylation was observed to be significantly higher in HCC than in benign, adjacent, or normal samples. Moreover, CDH1 hypermethylation was not associated with gender, tumor grade, clinical stage, hepatitis B virus (HBV), or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in HCC patients. H-cadherin (CDH13), protocadherin-10 (PCDH10), P-cadherin (CDH3), and CDH15 methylation may have an increased risk of HCC in fewer than 4 studies, and methylated CDH8 and CDH11 had a similar OR in HCC and adjacent samples. When HCC samples were compared with normal samples, the analysis of sample type revealed a significantly higher OR in normal blood samples than in normal tissues for hypermethylated CDH1 (50.82 vs 4.44). Conclusion: CDH1 hypermethylation may play a key role in the carcinogenesis of HCC. However, CDH1 hypermethylation was not correlated with clinicopathological features. Methylated CDH13, PCDH10, CDH3, and CDH15, but not methylated CDH8 or CDH11, may lead to an increased risk of HCC. Hypermethylated CDH1 may become a noninvasive blood biomarker.

Can Aidi injection restore the cellular immunity and improve the clinical efficacy in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated with platinum-based chemotherapy? There is a lack of strong evidence to prove it. To further reveal it, we systematically evaluated all related studies. We collected all studies about the clinical efficacy and cellular immunity of Aidi injection plus platinum-based chemotherapy for NSCLC in Medline, Embase, Web of Science, China national knowledge infrastructure database (CNKI), Chinese Scientific Journals Full-Text Database (VIP), Wanfang, China biological medicine database (CBM) (established to June 2015), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CCRCT) (June 2015), Chinese clinical trial registry, and US-clinical trials (June 2015). We evaluated their quality according to the Cochrane evaluation handbook of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (5.1.0), extracted data following the patient intervention control group outcomes principles and synthesized the data by meta-analysis. Seventeen (RCTs) with 1390 NSCLC patients were included, with general methodological quality in most trials. The merged relative risk (RR) values and their 95% CI of meta-analysis for objective response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR) were as follows: 1.26 (1.12, 1.42) and 1.11(1.04, 1.17). The merged standardized mean difference (SMD) values and their 95% CI of meta-analysis for the percentage of CD3(+)T cells, CD4(+)T cells, CD8(+)T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and CD4(+)/CD8(+)T cell ratio were as follows: 1.41, (0.89, 1.92), 1.59, (1.07, 2.11), 0.85, (0.38, 1.33), 1.64 (0.89, 2.39) and 0.91, (0.58, 1.24). Compared with platinum-based chemotherapy alone, all differences were statistically significant. These results might be overestimated or underestimated. Conclusions: Aidi injection plus platinum-based chemotherapy can improve the clinical efficacy of patients with NSCLC. Aidi injection could significantly restore the cellular immunity damaged by platinum-based chemotherapy. It may be an important tumor immune modulator and protector for patients with NSCLC treated with chemotherapy.","[Xiao, Zheng; Wang, Chengqiong; Li, Nana; Li, Jing; Chen, Ling] Zunyi Med Coll, MOE Virtual Res Ctr Evidence Based Med, Evidence Based Med Ctr, Zunyi 563000, Guizhou, Peoples R China; [Xiao, Zheng; Wang, Chengqiong; Li, Nana; Chen, Ling] Zunyi Med Coll, Affiliated Hosp, Dept Resp Med, Ctr Evidence Based & Translat Med Major Infect Di, Zunyi 563000, Guizhou, Peoples R China; [Sun, Yongping] Zunyi Med Coll, Teaching & Res Grp Evidence Based Med, Zhuhai Campus, Zhuhai, Guangdong, Peoples R China; [Yao, Xingsheng] Zunyi Med Coll, Dept Immunol, Zunyi, Guizhou, Peoples R China; [Ma, Hu] Zunyi Med Coll, Affiliated Hosp, Dept Oncol, Zunyi, Guizhou, Peoples R China; [Li, Jing] Zunyi Med Coll, Peoples Hosp Zunyi City 1, Dept Neurol, Zunyi, Guizhou, Peoples R China; [Li, Jing] Zunyi Med Coll, Affiliated Hosp 3, Zunyi, Guizhou, Peoples R China; [Ding, Jie] Zunyi Med Coll, Affiliated Hosp, Outpatient Dept, Psychol Counseling Clin,Ctr Evidence Based & Tran, Zunyi, Guizhou, Peoples R China",Zunyi Medical University; Zunyi Medical University; Zunyi Medical University; Zunyi Medical University; Zunyi Medical University; Zunyi Medical University; Zunyi Medical University; Zunyi Medical University,"Xiao, Z (corresponding author), Zunyi Med Coll, Affiliated Hosp, MOE Virtual Res Ctr Evidence Based Med, Evidence Based Med Ctr, Zunyi 563003, Guizhou Provinc, Peoples R China.",zy426f@163.com,"li, nana/KHX-9502-2024",,development fund of evidence-based transformation in Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical College [2016]; Zunyi Medical College [F-617]; planning fund of philosophy and social science in Guizhou [14GZYB58]; Fifth Science and Technology Innovation Team for Basic and Clinical Studies of Drug-resistant Tuberculosis in Guizhou Province [2012 4011],development fund of evidence-based transformation in Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical College; Zunyi Medical College; planning fund of philosophy and social science in Guizhou; Fifth Science and Technology Innovation Team for Basic and Clinical Studies of Drug-resistant Tuberculosis in Guizhou Province,"This work was funded by grants from development fund of evidence-based transformation in Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical College (No. 2016), doctoral fund of Zunyi Medical College (No. F-617), planning fund of philosophy and social science in Guizhou (No. 14GZYB58) and The Fifth Science and Technology Innovation Team for Basic and Clinical Studies of Drug-resistant Tuberculosis in Guizhou Province (No. 2012 4011).",,47,16,17,0,17,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",0025-7974,1536-5964,,MEDICINE,Medicine (Baltimore),NOV,2016,95,44,,,,,,,e5210,10.1097/MD.0000000000005210,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/MD.0000000000005210,,,9,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),General & Internal Medicine,ED0XG,27858864,"gold, Green Published",,,2024-11-25,WOS:000388566200029,View Full Record in Web of Science

Adenoidectomy and tonsillectomy were recommended for the promotion of balanced dentition growth in these children.The aim of this study was to determine the effect of adenoidectomy and tonsillectomy on the growth of dental morphology in children with airway obstruction.Methods:A comprehensive search of the Medline, Embase, Web of science, and OVID databases for studies published through to January 17, 2016 was conducted. Prospective, comparative, clinical studies assessing the efficacy of adenoidectomy, or tonsillectomy in children with airway obstruction were included. The weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were used for continuous variables. Forest plots were drawn to demonstrate effects in the meta-analyses.Results:Eight papers were included in our study. We found that adenoidectomy and tonsillectomy led to a significant change in nasal-breathing in children with airway obstruction. Children with airway obstruction had a significantly narrower posterior maxillary dental arch than children without airway obstruction (WMD = -0.94, 95% CI [-1.13, -0.76]; P<0.001). After surgery, these children still had a significantly narrower dental arch than the nasal-breathing children (WMD = -0.60, 95% CI [-0.79, -0.42]; P<0.001). In terms of dental arch width, malocclusion, palatal height, overjet, overbite, dental arch perimeter, and arch length, a tendency toward normalization was evident following adenoidectomy or tonsillectomy, with no significant differences evident between the surgical group and the normal group. The small number of studies and lack of randomized controlled trials were the main limitations of this meta-analysis.Conclusions:Following adenoidectomy and tonsillectomy, the malocclusion and narrow arch width of children with airway obstruction could not be completely reversed. Therefore, other treatments such as functional training or orthodontic maxillary widening should be considered after removing the obstruction in the airway.","[Zhu, Yanfei; Tang, Yanmei; Wang, Xiaoling; Xue, Xiaochen; Sun, Huijun; Nie, Ping; Zhu, Min] Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Coll Stomatol, Sch Med, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Li, Jiaying] Jining Med Univ, Jining, Shandong, Peoples R China; [Nie, Ping; Zhu, Min] Shanghai Ninth Peoples Hosp, Dept Oral & Craniomaxillofacial Sci, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Qu, Xinhua] Shanghai Ninth Peoples Hosp, Dept Orthopaed, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Qu, Xinhua] Shanghai Key Lab Orthopaed Implant, Shanghai, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Min] Shanghai Key Lab Stomatol, Shanghai, Peoples R China",Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Jining Medical University; Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Shanghai Jiao Tong University,"Zhu, M (corresponding author), Shanghai Jiao Tong Univ, Shanghai Peoples Hosp 9, Dept Oral & Craniomaxillofacial Sci, Sch Med,Shanghai Key Lab Stomatol, 500 Quxi Rd, Shanghai 200011, Peoples R China.",doctorzhumin@126.com,"Qu, Xinhua/Q-3950-2016; Nie, Ping/T-2767-2017; Wang, Xiaoling/R-6788-2016",,Shanghai Summit & Plateau Disciplines,Shanghai Summit & Plateau Disciplines,Supported by Shanghai Summit & Plateau Disciplines.

Guideline makers have raised concerns about the utility of existing evidence on the diagnostic accuracy of depression screening tools. The objective of our study was to evaluate the transparency and completeness of reporting in meta-analyses of the diagnostic accuracy of depression screening tools using the PRISMA tool adapted for diagnostic test accuracy meta-analyses. Methods: We searched MEDLINE and PsycINFO from January 1, 2005 through March 13, 2016 for recent meta analyses in any language on the diagnostic accuracy of depression screening tools. Two reviewers independently assessed the transparency in reporting using the PRISMA tool with appropriate adaptations made for studies of diagnostic test accuracy. Results: We identified 21 eligible meta-analyses. Twelve of 21 meta-analyses complied with at least 50% of adapted PRISMA items. Of 30 adapted PRISMA items, 11 were fulfilled by >= 80% of included meta-analyses, 3 by 50-79% of meta-analyses, 7 by 25-45% of meta-analyses, and 9 by <25%. On average, post-PRISMA meta-analyses complied with 17 of 30 items compared to 13 of 30 items pre-PRISMA. Conclusions: Deficiencies in the transparency of reporting in meta-analyses of the diagnostic test accuracy of depression screening tools of meta-analyses were identified. Authors, reviewers, and editors should adhere to the PRISMA statement to improve the reporting of meta-analyses of the diagnostic accuracy of depression screening tools. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The primary purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to analyze the available RCTs, comparing the effect of triclosan-coated suture with uncoated suture on the incidence of SSI after elective colorectal operations. As secondary endpoint of the analysis, we considered length of hospital stay after surgery.Methods:We performed a systematic literature review through Medline, Embase, Pubmed, Scopus, Ovid, ISI Web of Science, and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register searching for RCTs published from 1990 to 2015. To conduct these meta-analyses, we followed the guidelines and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement. Study inclusion criteria were as follows: parallel-group RCTs in adult populations reporting the closure of the abdominal wall after elective colorectal operation with triclosan-coated suture or noncoated suture, and reporting the outcomes considered in the meta-analysis.Results:Six trials including 2168 patients (1102 treated and 1066 controls) provided data on SSIs. The overall rate was 11.7% (129/1102) in the triclosan group and 13.4% (143/1066) in the control group (odds ratio 0.81, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.58-1.13, P=0.220). Heterogeneity among studies was moderate (I-2=44.9%). No evidence of publication bias was detectable. Five RCTs (1783 patients; 914 treated and 689 controls) described hospital length of stay with no significant effect (mean difference: -0.02, 95% CI -0.11 to -0.07, P=0.668). The I-2 test for heterogeneity was 0% (P=0.836). Moderator analyses showed no significant differences were detected in analyses comparing the suture materials (polydioxanone vs polyglactin). In open-label trials, the odds ratio for SSI risk was 0.62 (95% CI 0.20-1.93, P=0.413), 0.77 in single-blind (95% CI 0.31-1.95, P=0.583) and 0.85 in double-blind trials (95% CI 0.46-1.54, P=0.582).Conclusions:Our findings failed to demonstrate a significant protective effect of triclosan-coated sutures on the occurrence of SSI after elective colorectal resections. Further large RCTs are needed before introducing this technology into clinical practice.","[Sandini, Marta; Mattavelli, Ilaria; Nespoli, Luca; Uggeri, Fabio; Gianotti, Luca] Milano Bicocca Univ, Sch Med & Surg, San Gerardo Hosp, Monza, Italy",University of Milano-Bicocca; San Gerardo Hospital,"Gianotti, L (corresponding author), San Gerardo Hosp, Dept Surg, 4 Piano A,Via Pergolesi 33, I-20900 Monza, Italy.",luca.gianotti@unimib.it,"Uggeri, Fabio/ABG-1057-2021; Mattavelli, Ilaria/AAB-2247-2020","sandini, marta/0000-0002-2932-5218; UGGERI, FABIO/0000-0002-2209-3602; mattavelli, ilaria/0000-0001-5739-3376; NESPOLI, LUCA CARLO/0000-0002-4945-5677",,,,,41,29,30,0,8,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",0025-7974,1536-5964,,MEDICINE,Medicine (Baltimore),AUG,2016,95,35,,,,,,,e4057,10.1097/MD.0000000000004057,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/MD.0000000000004057,,,9,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),General & Internal Medicine,DX0HC,27583844,"gold, Green Published",,,2024-11-25,WOS:000384041400004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Can Aidi injection alleviate the toxicity and improve the clinical efficacy of radiotherapy in lung cancer? Has Aidi injection the attenuation and synergistic efficacy to radiotherapy? There is lack of strong evidence to prove it.Objectives:To reveal its real attenuation and synergistic efficacy to radiotherapy and provide sufficient evidence for adjuvant chemotherapy strategies to lung cancer, we systematically evaluated all related studies.Data Sources:We collected all studies about Aidi injection plus radiotherapy for lung cancer in Medline, Embase, Web of Science, China national knowledge infrastructure database (CNKI), Chinese scientific journals full-text database (VIP), Wanfang database, China biological medicine database (CBM) (established to June 2015), and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (June 2015), evaluated their quality according to the Cochrane evaluation handbook of randomized controlled trials (5.1.0), extracted data following the PICO principles and synthesized the data by Meta analysis.Results:Sixteen randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with 1192 lung cancer patients were included, with general methodological quality in most trials. The merged relative risk (RR) values and their 95% CI of meta-analysis for objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), and quality of life (QOL) were as follows: 1.54, (1.39,1.70), 1.10 (1.02, 1.19), and 2.13 (1.68, 2.68). The merged RR values and their 95% CI of meta-analysis for myelosuppression and neutropenia, radiation pneumonitis, and radiation esophagitis were as follows: 0.51 (0.38, 0.69), 0.53 (0.42, 0.65), 0.52 (0.41, 0.67), and 0.52 (0.40, 0.68). All were statistically significant. The possibility of publication bias was small which objectively reported the results.Conclusions:The evidence available indicates that Aidi injection plus radiotherapy can significantly improve the clinical efficacy and QOL of patients with lung cancer. Aidi injection can alleviate the myelosuppression, radiation pneumonitis, and radiation esophagitis of radiotherapy. It has the attenuation and synergistic efficacy to radiotherapy.","[Xiao, Zheng; Wang, Cheng-qiong; Li, Nana; He, Yuejuan; Tang, Fushan; Chen, Ling] Zunyi Med Coll, Affiliated Hosp, Evidence Based Med Ctr, MOE Virtual Res Ctr Evidence Based Med, Zunyi 563003, Guizhou Provinc, Peoples R China; [Xiao, Zheng; Wang, Cheng-qiong; Li, Nana; He, Yuejuan; Chen, Ling] Zunyi Med Coll, Affiliated Hosp, Dept Resp Med, Ctr Evidence Based & Translat Med Major Infect Di, Zunyi, Guizhou Provinc, Peoples R China; [Liang, Rui; Xu, Shaofeng] Zunyi Med Coll, Grade Students 2012, Dept Publ Hlth, Zunyi, Guizhou Provinc, Peoples R China; [Tang, Fushan] Zunyi Med Coll, Dept Clin Pharm, Zunyi, Guizhou Provinc, Peoples R China; [Ma, Hu] Zunyi Med Coll, Dept Oncol, Affiliated Hosp, Zunyi, Guizhou Provinc, Peoples R China",Zunyi Medical University; Zunyi Medical University; Zunyi Medical University; Zunyi Medical University; Zunyi Medical University,"Xiao, Z (corresponding author), Zunyi Med Coll, Affiliated Hosp, Evidence Based Med Ctr, MOE Virtual Res Ctr Evidence Based Med, Zunyi 563003, Guizhou Provinc, Peoples R China.",zy426f@163.com,"Xu, Shaofeng/U-3245-2018; li, nana/KHX-9502-2024; Tang, Fushan/AAW-6654-2020",,Development fund of evidence based transformation in Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical College [2016]; Doctoral Fund of Zunyi Medical College [F-617]; Planning fund of philosophy and social science in Guizhou [14GZYB58]; The Fifth Science and Technology Innovation Team for Basic and Clinical Studies of Drug-resistant Tuberculosis in Guizhou Province [2012 4011],Development fund of evidence based transformation in Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical College; Doctoral Fund of Zunyi Medical College; Planning fund of philosophy and social science in Guizhou; The Fifth Science and Technology Innovation Team for Basic and Clinical Studies of Drug-resistant Tuberculosis in Guizhou Province,"This work was funded by grants from Development fund of evidence based transformation in Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical College (No. 2016), Doctoral Fund of Zunyi Medical College (No. F-617), and Planning fund of philosophy and social science in Guizhou (No. 14GZYB58) and The Fifth Science and Technology Innovation Team for Basic and Clinical Studies of Drug-resistant Tuberculosis in Guizhou Province (No. 2012 4011).",,43,19,19,0,16,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",0025-7974,1536-5964,,MEDICINE,Medicine (Baltimore),AUG,2016,95,35,,,,,,,e4517,10.1097/MD.0000000000004517,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/MD.0000000000004517,,,8,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),General & Internal Medicine,DX0HC,27583861,"gold, Green Published",,,2024-11-25,WOS:000384041400021,View Full Record in Web of Science

Identifying the most effective ones and the patients' characteristics associated with best performance of the drugs will improve management of hypertensive patients. Objective: To assess the blood pressure (BP) reduction attributed to antihypertensive drugs and identify characteristics associated with BP decrease. Data sources: MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from inception through July 2012 and selected papers. Study eligibility criteria: Double-blind, randomized clinical trials whose main result was the reduction in BP by antihypertensive treatment, with study population = 50 or = 25 if the study was a crossover, follow-up of at least 8 weeks, and available required data. Study appraisal and synthesis methods: Study data were independently extracted by multiple observers and introduced in an electronic database. Inconsistencies were resolved by discussion and referral back to the original articles. Meta-analysis was performed according to PRISMA statement and using a Bayesian framework. Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s): Mean decrease in systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) achieved by each drug or combination. Results: Two hundred eight trials including 94,305 patients were identified. In monotherapy, most drugs achieved 10 to 15mm Hg SBP and 8 to 10mm Hg DBP decreases. Olmesartan/amlodipine, olmesartan/hydrochlorothiazide, felodipine/metoprolol, and valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide were the combinations leading to the greatest mean SBP reductions (> 20mm Hg). Female sex and body mass index > 25kg/m(2) were associated with more pronounced SBP and DBP reductions, whereas Afro-American ethnicity was associated with BP reductions smaller than the median. Results were adjusted by study duration, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes mellitus. Still, the estimation was performed using the mean administered doses, which do not exactly match those of the available drug formats. Limitations: Data corresponded to those obtained in each of the included trials; the analysis of the combinations was limited to the most recent ones; estimations were performed using the mean administered doses. Conclusions and implications: Certain drug combinations achieve BP reductions ranging from 20 to 25/10 to 15mmHg. Sex, ethnicity, and obesity are associated with antihypertensive response.

Systematic reviews provide Class 1 research evidence, are based upon an established rigor and communicate results in a comprehensive manner, and are therefore particularly relevant to clinicians and researchers. Clinician requirements for quality systematic reviews are twofold: to keep up to date with research and to make informed decisions including those required for diagnoses, disease or risk assessment, and treatment. Researchers rely upon quality systematic reviews to compete for diminishing research funds, prove efficacy for intervention trials, and to meet increasing demand for evidence based intervention. However, insufficient systematic reviews are undertaken, and the methodological rigor and quality are often variable. The aim of this article is to guide researchers through the iterative systematic review process in order to improve quality and thereby increase publication rates. The step by step guide provides a road map through the EQUATOR network and practical suggestions in order to meet the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) (Moher et al. 2009) as well as encouraging high standards through the use of quality rating scales. Lastly, information is provided to encourage quantitative analysis to improve the synthesis of results and qualitative interpretation, such as calculating effect sizes or conducting a meta-analyses as the ultimate goal of a systematic review.","[Gates, Nicola J.] Univ New South Wales, Ctr Hlth Brain Aging CHeBA, Med, Randwick, NSW 2031, Australia; [March, Evrim G.] St Vincents Mental Hlth, Fitzroy, Vic 3065, Australia; [March, Evrim G.] Univ Melbourne, Sch Psychol Sci, Parkville, Vic 3010, Australia",University of New South Wales Sydney; University of Melbourne,"Gates, NJ (corresponding author), Univ New South Wales, Ctr Hlth Brain Aging CHeBA, Med, Randwick, NSW 2031, Australia.",n.gates@unsw.edu.au,,,,,,,43,29,33,1,17,SPRINGER,NEW YORK,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",1040-7308,1573-6660,,NEUROPSYCHOL REV,Neuropsychol.

According to the PRISMA guidelines, we undertook an updated systematic review of all of the studies that have examined, in randomized controlled trials, the efficacy and tolerability of SGAs (as either monotherapy or augmentation) in the treatment of PD, with or without other comorbid psychiatric disorders. Studies until 31 December 2015 were identified through PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase, Cochrane Library and Clinical trials. gov. Among 210 studies, five were included (two involving patients with a principal diagnosis of PD and three involving patients with bipolar disorder with comorbid PD or generalized anxiety disorder). All were eight-week trials and involved treatments with quetiapine extended release, risperidone and ziprasidone. Overall, a general lack of efficacy of SGAs on panic symptoms was observed. Some preliminary indications of the antipanic effectiveness of risperidone are insufficient to support its use in PD, primarily due to major limitations of the study. However, several methodological limitations may have negatively affected all of these studies, decreasing the validity of the results and making it difficult to draw reliable conclusions. Except for ziprasidone, SGAs were well tolerated in these short-term trials.","[Giampaolo, Perna; Alessandra, Alciati; Raffaele, Balletta; Elisa, Mingotto; Giuseppina, Diaferia; Paolo, Cavedini; Maria, Nobile; Daniela, Caldirola] FoRiPsi, Villa San Benedetto Menni Hosp, Hermanas Hosp, Dept Clin Neurosci, Via Roma 16, I-22032 Albese Con Cassano, Como, Italy; [Giampaolo, Perna] Maastricht Univ, Fac Hlth Med & Life Sci, Dept Psychiat & Neuropsychol, NL-6200 Maastricht, Netherlands; [Giampaolo, Perna] Miami Univ, Leonard Miller Sch Med, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Miami, FL 33136 USA; [Maria, Nobile] IRCCS Eugenio Medea, Inst Sci, Child Psychopathol Unit, I-23842 Lecce, Italy",Maastricht University; IRCCS Eugenio Medea,"Giampaolo, P (corresponding author), FoRiPsi, Villa San Benedetto Menni Hosp, Hermanas Hosp, Dept Clin Neurosci, Via Roma 16, I-22032 Albese Con Cassano, Como, Italy.;Giampaolo, P (corresponding author), Maastricht Univ, Fac Hlth Med & Life Sci, Dept Psychiat & Neuropsychol, NL-6200 Maastricht, Netherlands.;Giampaolo, P (corresponding author), Miami Univ, Leonard Miller Sch Med, Dept Psychiat & Behav Sci, Miami, FL 33136 USA.",pernagp@gmail.com; alessandra.alciati@gmail.com; ballettalello@gmail.com; elisamingotto@gmail.com; g.diaferia@ospedaliere.it; p.cavedini@paolocavedini.com; maria.nobile4@gmail.com; caldiroladaniela@gmail.com,"Alciati, Alessandra/M-2298-2019; Perna, Giampaolo/K-5194-2013; Nobile, Maria/B-3683-2013","Perna, Giampaolo/0000-0002-8166-0785; Nobile, Maria/0000-0002-9917-4275; Caldirola, Daniela/0000-0002-1461-9475",,,,,59,7,8,0,4,MDPI,BASEL,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",1661-6596,1422-0067,,INT J MOL SCI,Int.

A fully recursive literature search of the primary electronic data-bases for available trials was performed. The objective response rate (ORR) and the median progression-free survival (PFS) of clinical responses were considered the main endpoints to evaluate the efficacy, whereas Grade 3-4 adverse effects (AEs) were analyzed to evaluate safety. The ORR of PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors was 30% (95% CI: 25-35%). No significant difference in the ORR was observed after the comparisons of low-dose, median-dose, and high-dose cohorts. In addition, the rate of Grade 3-4 AEs was 9% (95% CI: 6-12%). According to the 3 randomized controlled trials that compared PD-1 inhibitors with chemotherapy, the difference between these 2 groups was found to be statistically significant with respect to the ORR, PFS and the incidence of Grade 3-4 AEs; that is, the relative risk (RR) of the ORR was 3.42 (95% CI: 2.49-4.69, P< 0.001), the hazard ratio (HR) of the PFS was 0.50 (95% CI: 0.44-0.58, P< 0.001), and the RR of Grade 3-4 AEs was 0.45 (95% CI: 0.31-0.65, P< 0.001).

They are an increasingly important tool within evidence-based medicine, guiding clinical practice, future research, and health care policy. OBJECTIVE To determine the reporting quality of recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses in plastic surgery with the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement. METHODS MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched for systematic reviews published between January 1, 2013, and December 31, 2014, in 5 major plastic surgery journals. Screening, identification, and data extraction were performed independently by 2 teams. Articles were reviewed for compliance with reporting of 27 items in the PRISMA checklist. Data analysis was conducted from January 1 to July 30, 2015. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The sum of PRISMA checklist items (1-27) per systematic review. RESULTS From an initial set of 163 articles, 79 met the inclusion criteria. The median PRISMA score was 16 of 27 items (59%) (range, 6%-26%; 95% CI, 14%-17%). Compliance varied between individual PRISMA items. It was poorest for items related to the use of review protocol (item 5; 4 articles [5%]) and presentation of data on the risk of bias of each study (item 19; 14 articles [18%]). Compliance was the highest for description of rationale (item 3; 78 articles [99%]), sources of funding and other support (item 27; 75 articles [95%]), and inclusion of a structured summary in the abstract (item 2; 75 articles [95%]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The reporting quality of systematic reviews in plastic surgery requires improvement. Enforcement of compliance through journal submission systems, as well as improved education, awareness, and a cohesive strategy among all stakeholders, is called for.","[Lee, Seon-Young] Southampton Med Sch, Fac Med, Tremona Rd, Southampton SO16 6YD, Hants, England; [Sagoo, Harkiran] Guys Kings & St Thomas Sch Med Educ, London, England; [Whitehurst, Katharine] UCL, London, England; [Wellstead, Georgina] Queen Mary Univ London, Barts & London Sch Med & Dent, London, England; [Fowler, Alexander J.] Barts & London Queen Marys Sch Med & Dent, London, England; [Agha, Riaz A.] Univ Oxford, Guys & St Thomas NHS Fdn Trust, Oxford, England; [Agha, Riaz A.] Univ Oxford Balliol Coll, Oxford OX1 3BJ, England; [Orgill, Dennis] Harvard Univ, Brigham & Womens Hosp, Sch Med, Boston, MA 02115 USA",University of Southampton; University of London; University College London; University of London; Queen Mary University London; University of London; Queen Mary University London; University of Oxford; University of Oxford; Harvard University; Harvard Medical School; Brigham & Women's Hospital,"Lee, SY (corresponding author), Southampton Med Sch, Fac Med, Tremona Rd, Southampton SO16 6YD, Hants, England.",tsy159@gmail.com,"Agha, Riaz/KLC-2726-2024; Fowler, Alex/AGG-1569-2022; Orgill, Dennis/H-7596-2019",,,,,,17,27,28,0,3,AMER MEDICAL ASSOC,CHICAGO,"330 N WABASH AVE, STE 39300, CHICAGO, IL 60611-5885 USA",2168-6076,2168-6092,,JAMA FACIAL PLAST SU,JAMA Facial Plast.

However, increasing evidence indicates that the safety of bupropion in BD patients may not be as good as previously thought. The aim of this study was to summarize data on the treatment effect and safety profile of bupropion in the treatment of BD via a meta-analysis. Electronic search through PubMed and ClinicalTrials.gov was performed. The inclusion criteria were: (i) studies comparing changes in disease severity before and after bupropion treatment or articles comparing the treatment effect of bupropion in BD patients with those receiving other standard treatments; (ii) articles on clinical trials in humans. The exclusion criteria were (i) case reports/series, and (ii) nonclinical trials. All effect sizes from 10 clinical trials were pooled using a random effects model. We examined the possible confounding variables using meta-regression and subgroup analysis. Bupropion significantly improved the severity of disease in BD patients (P<0.001), and the treatment effect was similar to other antidepressants/standard treatments (P=0.220). There were no significant differences in the dropout rate (P=0.285) and rate of phase shifting (P=0.952) between BD patients who received bupropion and those who received other antidepressants. We could not perform a detailed meta-analysis of every category of antidepressant, nor could we rule out the possible confounding effect of concurrent psychotropics or include all drug side effects. Furthermore, the number of studies recruited in the meta-analysis was relatively small. Our findings reconfirm the benefits of bupropion for the treatment of bipolar depression, which are similar to those of other antidepressants. However, the rate of phase shifting with bupropion usage was not as low compared to other antidepressants as previously thought, which should serve to remind clinicians of the risk of phase shifting when prescribing bupropion to BD patients regardless of the suggestions of current clinical practice guidelines.","[Li, Dian-Jeng] Kaohsiung Municipal Kai Syuan Psychiat Hosp, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; [Tseng, Ping-Tao; Wu, Ching-Kuan] Tsyr Huey Mental Hosp, Dept Psychiat, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; [Chen, Yen-Wen] E Da Hosp, Dept Neurol, Seoul, South Korea; [Lin, Pao-Yen] Kaohsiung Chang Gung Mem Hosp, Dept Psychiat, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; Chang Gung Univ, Coll Med, Seoul, South Korea; [Lin, Pao-Yen] Kaohsiung Chang Gung Mem Hosp, Inst Translat Res Biomed Sci, Kaohsiung, Taiwan",Chang Gung Memorial Hospital; Chang Gung Memorial Hospital,"Lin, PY (corresponding author), Kaohsiung Chang Gung Mem Hosp, Dept Psychiat, Kaohsiung, Taiwan.",py1029@adm.cgmh.org.tw,"Lin, Pao-Yen/V-2495-2019; Li, Dian-Jeng/T-7571-2019","Li, Dian-Jeng/0000-0002-6036-045X",,,,,61,9,10,0,8,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",0025-7974,1536-5964,,MEDICINE,Medicine (Baltimore),MAR,2016,95,13,,,,,,,e3165,10.1097/MD.0000000000003165,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/MD.0000000000003165,,,8,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED); Social Science Citation Index (SSCI),General & Internal Medicine,DK9NE,27043678,"Green Published, gold",,,2024-11-25,WOS:000375256500012,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study aimed to determine their relationship thorough a meta-analysis of articles on their comorbidity rate. The aim of the study is to examine the overall prevalence rate of BD in asthmatic patients and of asthma in BD patients compared to healthy controls. Electronic research of PubMed and ClinicalTrials.gov was performed. Articles discussing the prevalence rate of BD in patients with/without asthma and the prevalence rate of asthma in those with/without BD, as well as clinical trials in humans and case-controlled trials or cohort studies, were all included. Case reports or series and nonclinical trials were excluded. Through a random-effects model, a meta-analysis of the results of 4 studies comparing the prevalence rate of BD in patients with/without asthma, and in 6 studies comparing the prevalence rate of asthma in subjects with/without BD were performed.There were significantly higher prevalence rates of BD in asthmatic patients than in healthy controls (P<0.001) and of asthma in BD patients than in healthy controls (P<0.001). Only the patient's mean age significantly modulated the odds ratio of the prevalence rate of asthma in BD patients (slope=0.015, P<0.001). Only 10 studies were included and most were cross-sectional studies. The possible confounding effect of medication on BD or asthma onset was not investigated.

Systematic reviews often compound poor reporting of harms in primary studies by failing to report harms or doing so inadequately. While the PRISMA statement (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) helps systematic review authors ensure complete and transparent reporting, it is focused mainly on efficacy. Thus, a PRISMA harms checklist has been developed to improve harms reporting in systematic reviews, promoting a more balanced assessment of benefits and harms. METHODS A development strategy, endorsed by the EQUATOR Network and existing reporting guidelines (including the PRISMA statement, PRISMA for abstracts, and PRISMA for protocols), was used. After the development of a draft checklist of items, a modified Delphi process was initiated. The Delphi consisted of three rounds of electronic feedback followed by an in-person meeting. RESULTS The PRISMA harms checklist contains four essential reporting elements to be added to the original PRISMA statement to improve harms reporting in reviews. These are reported in the title (Specifically mention 'harms' or other related terms, or the harm of interest in the review), synthesis of results (Specify how zero events were handled, if relevant), study characteristics (Define each harm addressed, how it was ascertained (eg, patient report, active search), and over what time period), and synthesis of results (Describe any assessment of possible causality). Additional guidance regarding existing PRISMA items was developed to demonstrate relevance when synthesising information about harms. CONCLUSION The PRISMA harms checklist identifies a minimal set of items to be reported when reviewing adverse events. This guideline extension is intended to improve harms reporting in systematic reviews, whether harms are a primary or secondary outcome.","[Zorzela, Liliane; Vohra, Sunita] Univ Alberta, Fac Med & Dent, Edmonton, AB T6G 2C8, Canada; [Zorzela, Liliane; Vohra, Sunita] Univ Alberta, Integrat Hlth Inst, Edmonton, AB T6G 2C8, Canada; [Loke, Yoon K.] Norwich Med Sch, Norwich, Norfolk, England; [Ioannidis, John P.] Stanford Univ, Sch Humanities & Sci, Sch Med, Stanford, CA 94305 USA; [Golder, Su] Univ York, Dept Hlth Sci, Heslington, England; [Santaguida, Pasqualina] McMaster Univ, Dept Clin Epidemiol & Biostat, Hamilton, ON, Canada; [Altman, Douglas G.] Univ Oxford, Botnar Res Ctr, Nuffield Dept Orthopaed Rheumatol & Musculoskelet, Ctr Stat Med, Oxford, England; [Moher, David] Ottawa Hosp, Ottawa Hosp Res Inst, Ottawa Methods Ctr, Ottawa, ON, Canada",University of Alberta; University of Alberta; University of East Anglia; Stanford University; University of York - UK; McMaster University; University of Oxford; University of Ottawa; Ottawa Hospital Research Institute,"Vohra, S (corresponding author), Univ Alberta, Fac Med & Dent, Edmonton, AB T6G 2C8, Canada.;Vohra, S (corresponding author), Univ Alberta, Integrat Hlth Inst, Edmonton, AB T6G 2C8, Canada.",svohra@ualberta.ca,"Moher, David/I-3408-2019; Ioannidis, John/G-9836-2011; Vohra, Sunita/F-5755-2016; Singh, Sonal/A-4614-2008; Shamseer, Larissa/E-9645-2017","Singh, Sonal/0000-0003-0912-941X; Witt, Prof. Dr. med., Claudia M./0000-0002-5440-7805; Golder, Su/0000-0002-8987-5211; Clark, Jocalyn/0000-0002-8014-3989; Moher, David/0000-0003-2434-4206; Shamseer, Larissa/0000-0003-3690-3378","Alberta Innovates, Health Solutions; National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR) [PDF-2014-07-041] Funding Source: National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)","Alberta Innovates, Health Solutions(Alberta Heritage Foundation for Medical Research); National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR)(National Institutes of Health Research (NIHR))","PRISMA harms was partly funded by Alberta Innovates, Health Solutions.

The aim was to compare the quality of reporting of abstracts of SRs including meta-analysis published in high-impact general medicine journals before and after publication of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) extension for abstracts (PRISMA-A) released in April 2013. Methods: SRs including meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials published in 2012, 2014, and 2015 in top-tier general medicine journals were searched in PubMed. Data was selected and extracted by two reviewers based on the PRISMA-A guidelines which recommend to include 12 items. The primary outcome was the adjusted mean number of items reported; the secondary outcome was the reporting of each item and factors associated with a better reporting. Adjustment was made for abstract word count and format, number of authors, PRISMA endorsement, and publication on behalf of a group. Results: We included 84 abstracts from 2012, 59 from 2014, and 61 from 2015. The mean number of items reported in 2015 (7.5; standard deviation [SD] 1.6) and in 2014 (6.8; SD 1.6) differed and did not differ from that reported in 2012 (7.2; SD 1.7), respectively; adjusted mean difference: 0.9 (95 % CI 0.4; 1.3) and -0.1 (95 % CI -0.6; 0.4). From 2012 to 2014, the quality of reporting was in regression for strengths and limitations of evidence and funding; contrariwise, it remained unchanged for the others items. Between 2012 and 2015, the quality of reporting rose up for description of the effect, synthesis of results, interpretation, and registration; but decreased for strengths and limitations of evidence; it remained unchanged for the other items. The overall better reporting was associated with abstracts structured in the 8-headings format in 2014 and abstracts with a word count <300 in 2014 and 2015. Conclusions: Not surprisingly, the quality of reporting did not improve in 2014 and suboptimally improved in 2015. There is still room for improvement to meet the standards of PRISMA-A guidelines. Stricter adherence to these guidelines by authors, reviewers, and journal editors is highly warranted and will surely contribute to a better reporting.","[Bigna, Jean Joel R.] Ctr Pasteur Cameroon, Dept Epidemiol & Publ Hlth, Yaounde, Cameroon; [Um, Lewis N.; Nansseu, Jobert Richie N.] Univ Yaounde I, Fac Med & Biomed Sci, Yaounde, Cameroon; [Nansseu, Jobert Richie N.] Chantal Biya Fdn, Sickle Cell Dis Unit, Mother & Child Ctr, Yaounde, Cameroon",University of Yaounde I,"Bigna, JJR (corresponding author), Ctr Pasteur Cameroon, Dept Epidemiol & Publ Hlth, Yaounde, Cameroon.",bignarimjj@yahoo.fr,"Bigna, Jean Joel/A-1781-2015","Bigna, Jean Joel/0000-0001-8018-6279",,,,,35,34,34,0,4,BMC,LONDON,"CAMPUS, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,2046-4053,,SYST REV-LONDON,Syst.

Quality of conduct and reporting has been described in the rapid review literature; however, no formal assessment has been carried out using available instruments. The objective of this study was to explore compliance with conduct and reporting guidelines in rapid reviews published or posted online during 2013 and 2014. Methods: We performed a comprehensive literature search for rapid reviews using multiple bibliographic databases (e.g. PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library) through December 31, 2014. Grey literature was searched thoroughly, and health technology assessment agencies were surveyed to identify additional rapid review products. Candidate reviews were assessed for inclusion using pre-specified eligibility criteria. Detailed data was collected from the included reviews on study and reporting characteristics and variables significant to rapid reviews (e.g. nomenclature, definition). We evaluated the quality of conduct and reporting of included rapid reviews using the A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) checklists. Compliance with each checklist item was examined, and the sum of adequately reported items was used to describe overall compliance. Rapid reviews were stratified to explore differences in compliance related to publication status. The association between compliance and time to completion or length of publication was explored through univariate regression. Results: Sixty-six rapid reviews were included. There were heterogeneous nomenclature, research questions and approaches to rapid reviews. Compliance with AMSTAR and PRISMA checklists was poor. Published rapid reviews were compliant with individual PRISMA items more often than unpublished reviews, but no difference was seen in AMSTAR item compliance overall. There was evidence of an association between length of publication and time to completion and the number of adequately reported PRISMA or AMSTAR items. Conclusions: Transparency and inadequate reporting are significant limitations of rapid reviews. Scientific editors, authors and producing agencies should ensure that the reporting of conduct and findings is accurate and complete. Further research may be warranted to explore reporting and conduct guidelines specific to rapid reviews and how these guidelines may be applied across the spectrum of rapid review approaches.","[Kelly, Shannon E.; Moher, David; Clifford, Tammy J.] Univ Ottawa, Sch Epidemiol Publ Hlth & Prevent Med, H2267A-40 Ruskin St, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Kelly, Shannon E.] Univ Ottawa Heart Inst, Cardiovasc Res Methods Ctr, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Moher, David] Ottawa Hosp Res Inst, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Clifford, Tammy J.] Canadian Agcy Drugs & Technol Hlth, Ottawa, ON, Canada",University of Ottawa; University of Ottawa; University of Ottawa Heart Institute; University of Ottawa; Ottawa Hospital Research Institute,"Kelly, SE (corresponding author), Univ Ottawa, Sch Epidemiol Publ Hlth & Prevent Med, H2267A-40 Ruskin St, Ottawa, ON, Canada.;Kelly, SE (corresponding author), Univ Ottawa Heart Inst, Cardiovasc Res Methods Ctr, Ottawa, ON, Canada.",skelly@ottawaheart.ca,"Moher, David/I-3408-2019","Moher, David/0000-0003-2434-4206; Kelly, Shannon/0000-0002-5520-6095",Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health,Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health,"The authors would like to acknowledge Leigh-Ann Topfer (LAT) for her assistance with the literature search and updates and for helping with the initial screening of the rapid review samples.

In addition, IGF-1 can mediate an antidepressant effect in patients with major affective disorder, and its levels in the cerebrospinal fluid have been found to vary with antidepressant treatment. Furthermore, it has been proven to crossover the blood-brain barrier, with a reciprocal feedback loop being the central effect. However, recent studies have reported inconclusive findings about the role of IGF-1 in major affective disorder. The aim of the current study was to conduct a thorough meta-analysis of changes in peripheral IGF-1 levels in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) or bipolar disorder (BD). We conducted a thorough literature search and compared peripheral IGF-1 levels in patients with MDD or BD and in healthy controls, and investigated clinical variables through meta-regression. Electronic research was conducted through platform of PubMed. We used inclusion criteria as clinical trials discussing comparisons of peripheral IGF-1 protein levels in patients with MDD or BD and those in healthy controls. We analyzed the cases from 9 studies with the random-effect model. The main finding was that peripheral IGF-1 levels in the patients were significantly higher than in the healthy controls (P 0.001), with a significant inverse association with duration of illness (P = 0.03). In meta-analysis comparing peripheral IGF-1 levels in patients with BD or MDD before and after treatment, there was no significant change in peripheral IGF-1 levels after treatment (P = 0.092). The small numbers of studies and lack of correlation data with growth hormone in current studies are the main limitations of this meta-analysis. Our results indicated that peripheral IGF-1 levels may not be an indicator of disease severity, but may be a disease trait marker or an indicator of cognition. However, further investigations on the correlation between cognitive function and peripheral IGF-1 levels are needed to explore the role of IGF-1 in the pathophysiology of MDD and BD.","[Tu, Kun-Yu; Wang, Hung-Yu; Wu, Ching-Kuan; Tseng, Ping-Tao] Tsyr Huey Mental Hosp, Dept Psychiat, 509 Fengping 1st Rd, Kaohsiung 831, Taiwan; [Chen, Yen-Wen] E Da Hosp, Dept Neurol, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; [Wu, Ming-Kung; Lin, Pao-Yen] Kaohsiung Chang Gung Mem Hosp, Dept Psychiat, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; [Wu, Ming-Kung; Lin, Pao-Yen] Chang Gung Univ, Coll Med, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; [Lin, Pao-Yen] Kaohsiung Chang Gung Mem Hosp, Ctr Translat Res Biomed Sci, Kaohsiung, Taiwan",E-Da Hospital; Chang Gung Memorial Hospital; Chang Gung University; Chang Gung Memorial Hospital,"Tseng, PT (corresponding author), Tsyr Huey Mental Hosp, Dept Psychiat, 509 Fengping 1st Rd, Kaohsiung 831, Taiwan.",ducktseng@gmail.com,"Lin, Pao-Yen/V-2495-2019","Wang, Hung-Yu/0000-0001-7969-783X",,,,,57,37,38,0,5,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",0025-7974,1536-5964,,MEDICINE,Medicine (Baltimore),JAN,2016,95,4,,,,,,,e2411,10.1097/MD.0000000000002411,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/MD.0000000000002411,,,8,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),General & Internal Medicine,DE3JH,26825882,"gold, Green Published",,,2024-11-25,WOS:000370524200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Then, we did this meta-analysis based on PRISMA guideline. The primary outcomes included fatal death, cerebral palsy (CP), intraventricular hemorrhage, and periventricular leukomalacia. Secondary outcomes included various neonatal and maternal outcomes.Ten studies including 6 randomized controlled trials and 5 cohort studies, and involving 18,655 preterm infants were analyzed. For the rate of moderate to severe CP, MgSO4 showed the ability to reduce the risk and achieved statistically significant difference (odd ratio [OR] 0.61, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.42-0.89, P = 0.01). The comparison of mortality rate between the MgSO4 group and the placebo group only presented small difference clinically, but reached no statistical significance (OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.77-1.11, P = 0.39). Summarily, the analysis of adverse effects on babies showed no margin (P>0.05). Yet for mothers, MgSO4 exhibited obvious side-effects, such as respiratory depression, nausea and so forth, but there exited great heterogeneity.MgSO4 administered to women at high risk of preterm labor could reduce the risk of moderate to severe CP, without obvious adverse effects on babies. Although there exit many unfavorable effects on mothers, yet they may be lessened through reduction of the dose of MgSO4 and could be tolerable for mothers. So MgSO4 is both beneficial and safety to be used as a neuroprotective agent for premature infants before a valid alternative was discovered.","[Zeng, Xianling; Xue, Yan; Tian, Quan; Sun, Rong; An, Ruifang] Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, Affiliated Hosp 1, Xian 710061, Shaanxi, Peoples R China",Xi'an Jiaotong University,"An, RF (corresponding author), Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Dept Obstet & Gynecol, Affiliated Hosp 1, Xian 710061, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.",anruifangxj@163.com,"sun, rong/JRX-7214-2023",,,,,,29,46,46,0,19,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",0025-7974,1536-5964,,MEDICINE,Medicine (Baltimore),JAN,2016,95,1,,,,,,,e2451,10.1097/MD.0000000000002451,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/MD.0000000000002451,,,12,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),General & Internal Medicine,DE3ID,26735551,"Green Published, gold",,,2024-11-25,WOS:000370520200030,View Full Record in Web of Science

In the meta-regression, mean age of subjects modulated the difference in BMD between patients and control subjects (P<0.001). In addition, the BMD in SCHIZ taking PR was significantly lower than in those taking PS (P=0.006).Our study can only point to the phenomenon that BMD in SCHIZ is lower than that in HCs, and cannot reveal any possible pathophysiology or mechanism of this phenomenon. In addition, we could not rule out the possible effect of medication on BMD based on the results of the meta-analysis of comparison of BMD in SCHIZ receiving PR and PS.The main result of our meta-analysis suggests that BMD is significantly lower in SCHIZ than in HCs. Our study emphasizes the importance of further screening for the risk of osteoporosis in young-aged schizophrenic patients, especially those taking PR, which are in high risk of fracture.","[Tseng, Ping-Tao; Tu, Kun-Yu; Cheng, Yu-Shian; Wu, Ching-Kuan] Kaohsiung Jen Ais Home, Tsyr Huey Mental Hosp, Dept Psychiat, 509,Fengping 1st Rd, Kaohsiung 831, Taiwan; [Chen, Yen-Wen] E Da Hosp, Dept Neurol, Kaohsiung, Taiwan; [Yeh, Pin-Yang] Natl Cheng Kung Univ, Coll Med, Inst Allied Hlth Sci, Tainan, Taiwan; [Yeh, Pin-Yang] Tsyr Huey Mental Hosp, Dept Clin Psychol, Kaohsiung, Taiwan",E-Da Hospital; National Cheng Kung University,"Tseng, PT (corresponding author), Kaohsiung Jen Ais Home, Tsyr Huey Mental Hosp, Dept Psychiat, 509,Fengping 1st Rd, Kaohsiung 831, Taiwan.",ducktseng@gmail.com,,,,,,,56,41,43,0,8,LIPPINCOTT WILLIAMS & WILKINS,PHILADELPHIA,"TWO COMMERCE SQ, 2001 MARKET ST, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19103 USA",0025-7974,1536-5964,,MEDICINE,Medicine (Baltimore),NOV,2015,94,47,,,,,,,e1967,10.1097/MD.0000000000001967,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/MD.0000000000001967,,,11,"Medicine, General & Internal",Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),General & Internal Medicine,DC9KB,26632691,"Green Published, gold",,,2024-11-25,WOS:000369539300015,View Full Record in Web of Science

The present paper aims to uncover key information related to the use of video game in ADHD neuropsychological rehabilitation/intervention by focusing on its gains and its capability to transfer/generalize these gains to real life situation via a systematic review of the empirical literature. The PRISMA guidelines were adopted. Internet-based bibliographic searches were conducted via seven major electronic databases (i.e., PsycARTICLES, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Core Collection BIOSIS Citation Index, MEDLINE, SciELO Citation Index, and PubMed) to access studies examining the association between video game interventions in ADHD patients and behavioral and cognitive outcomes. A total of 14 empirical studies meeting the inclusion criteria were identified. The studies reported the attention, working memory, and the behavioral aspects as the main target of the intervention. Cognitive and behavioral gains were reported after the video game training (VGT). However, many bias related to the choice of outcome instruments, sampling and blindness of assessors, weaken the results power. Additional researches are important to clarify the effects and stability of the VGT programs, and an important effort should be made to construct better methods to assess improvements on everyday cognitive abilities and real world functioning.","[Rivero, Thiago Strahler; Amodeo Bueno, Orlando Francisco] Univ Fed Sao Paulo, Dept Psicobiol, Grp Invest Memoria Humana, Sao Paulo, Brazil; [Herrera Nunez, Lina Maria] Univ Libre, Dept Psicol, Cali, Colombia; [Pires, Emmy Uehara] Univ Fed Rural Rio de Janeiro, Dept Psicol, Seropedica, Brazil",Universidade Federal de Sao Paulo (UNIFESP); Universidade Federal Rural do Rio de Janeiro (UFRRJ),"Rivero, TS (corresponding author), Univ Fed Sao Paulo, Dept Psicobiol, Grp Invest Memoria Humana, Sao Paulo, Brazil.",thiagorivero@gmail.com,"; Uehara, Emmy/H-2137-2016","Herrera Nunez, Lina Maria/0000-0001-7891-7212; Uehara, Emmy/0000-0002-3845-4839",,,,,54,35,37,9,60,FRONTIERS MEDIA SA,LAUSANNE,"AVENUE DU TRIBUNAL FEDERAL 34, LAUSANNE, CH-1015, SWITZERLAND",1664-0640,,,FRONT PSYCHIATRY,Front.

However, poor conduct or reporting of SRs and MAs may reduce their utility. The PRISMA Statement (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) was developed to help authors report their SRs and MAs adequately. Objectives Our objectives were to (1) evaluate the quality of reporting of SRs and MAs and their abstracts in otorhinolaryngologic literature using the PRISMA and PRISMA for Abstracts checklists, respectively, (2) compare the quality of reporting of SRs and MAs published in Ear Nose Throat (ENT) journals to the quality of SRs and MAs published in the 'gold standard' Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR), and (3) formulate recommendations to improve reporting of SRs and MAs in ENT journals. Methods On September 3, 2014, we searched the Pubmed database using a combination of filters to retrieve SRs and MAs on otorhinolaryngologic topics published in 2012 and 2013 in the top 5 ENT journals (ISI Web of Knowledge 2013) or CDSR and relevant articles were selected. We assessed how many, and which, PRISMA (for Abstracts) items were reported adequately per journal type. Results We identified large differences in the reporting of individual items between the two journal types with room for improvement. In general, SRs and MAs published in ENT journals (n = 31) reported a median of 54.4% of the PRISMA items adequately, whereas the 49 articles published in the CDSR reported a median of 100.0 adequately (difference statistically significant, p < 0.001). For abstracts, medians of 41.7% for ENT journals and 75.0% for the CDSR were found ( p < 0.001). Conclusion The reporting of SRs and MAs in ENT journals leaves room for improvement and would benefit if the PRISMA Statement were endorsed by these journals.","[Peters, Jeroen P.

Other reporting guidelines and techniques to assess methodological quality of SRs have been developed. We aimed to assess the frequency of the use of reporting and other guidelines in SRs to assess whether PRISMA is being used inappropriately as a substitute for other relevant guidelines. Methods: Web of Knowledge was searched to identify articles citing the PRISMA guidelines over a 12-month period. The use of reporting guidelines (including PRISMA and MOOSE) and tools for assessing methodological quality (including QUADAS) was assessed. Factors associated with appropriate use of guidelines including review type, field of publication and involvement of a methodologist were investigated. Results: Over the 12-month period, 701 SRs were identified. MOOSE guidelines were cited in just 17% of epidemiologic reviews; QUADAS or QUADAS-2 was referred to in just 40% of diagnostic SRs. In the multivariable analysis, medical field of publication and methodologist involvement (OR = 1.97, 95% CI: 1.37, 2.83) were significant predictors of appropriate use of guidelines. Inclusion of a meta-analysis resulted in 73% higher odds of appropriate usage of systematic review guidelines (OR = 1.73, 95% CI: 1.22, 2.35). Conclusions: Usage of SR reporting guidelines and tools for assessment of methodological quality other than PRISMA may be under-utilized with negative implications both for the reporting and methodological quality of systematic reviews.","[Fleming, Padhraig S.] Queen Mary Univ London, Inst Dent, Barts & London Sch Med & Dent, London, England; [Koletsi, Despina] Univ Athens, Dept Orthodont, Athens, Greece; [Pandis, Nikolaos] Univ Bern, Dept Orthodont, Bern, Switzerland",University of London; Queen Mary University London; National & Kapodistrian University of Athens; University of Bern,"Fleming, PS (corresponding author), Queen Mary Univ London, Inst Dent, Barts & London Sch Med & Dent, London, England.",padhraig.fleming@gmail.com,"Koletsi, Despina/AAX-9366-2020","Koletsi, Despina/0000-0001-6280-9372",,,,,17,63,66,3,17,PUBLIC LIBRARY SCIENCE,SAN FRANCISCO,"1160 BATTERY STREET, STE 100, SAN FRANCISCO, CA 94111 USA",1932-6203,,,PLOS ONE,PLoS One,MAY 1,2014,9,5,,,,,,,e96407,10.1371/journal.pone.0096407,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0096407,,,7,Multidisciplinary Sciences,Science Citation Index Expanded (SCI-EXPANDED),Science & Technology - Other Topics,AG6EE,24788774,"Green Published, gold, Green Submitted",,,2024-11-25,WOS:000335510600098,View Full Record in Web of Science

Materials and Methods: Systematic reviews and meta-analyses published in major radiology journals between January 2007 and December 2011 were identified by searching MEDLINE with the modified Montori method. Studies were reviewed independently by two investigators and assessed for adherence to the AMSTAR and PRISMA checklists. The average results were analyzed to assess for change in mean score before and after PRISMA publication and to assess results over time; a Pearson correlation coefficient was calculated to assess for any association between PRISMA and AMSTAR results. Results: Included were 130 studies from 11 journals. Average PRISMA and AMSTAR results were 21.8 of 27 and 7.2 of 11, respectively. The average result was higher after publication of PRISMA, and PRISMA-reported items were 22.6 of 27 after publication of PRISMA versus 20.9 of 27 before publication of PRISMA; AMSTAR results were 7.7 of 11 after publication of PRISMA versus 6.7 of 11 before publication of PRISMA. There was a strong positive correlation (r = 0.86) between the PRISMA and AMSTAR results. There was high variability between journals. Radiology had the highest PRISMA reported items (24.7 of 27), and American Journal of Neuroradiology had the lowest (19.6 of 27). Two major areas for improvement include study protocol registration and assessment of risk of bias across studies (ie, publication bias). Conclusion: In major radiology journal studies, there was modest improvement in completeness of reporting of systematic reviews and meta-analyses, assessed by PRISMA, which was strongly associated with higher study quality, assessed by AMSTAR.

In light of the global commitment to health equity, we have previously developed and published a reporting guideline for equity-focused systematic reviews (PRISMA-E 2012). The objectives of this study were to explore the utility of the equity extension items included in PRISMA-E 2012 from a systematic review author perspective, including facilitators and barriers to its use. This will assist in designing dissemination and knowledge translation strategies. We conducted a survey of systematic review authors to expose them to the new items in PRISMA-E 2012, establish the extent to which they had historically addressed those items in their own reviews, and gather feedback on the usefulness of the new items. Data were analysed using Microsoft Excel 2008 and Stata (version 11.2 for Mac). Of 151 respondents completing the survey, 18.5% (95% CI: 12.7% to 25.7%) had not heard of the PRISMA statement before, although 83.4% (95% CI: 77.5% to 89.3%) indicated that they plan to use PRISMA-E 2012 in the future, depending on the focus of their review. Most (68.9%; 95% CI: 60.8% to 76.2%) thought that using PRISMA-E 2012 would lead them to conduct their reviews differently. Important facilitators to using PRISMA-E 2012 identified by respondents were journal endorsement and incorporation of the elements of the guideline into systematic review software. Barriers identified were lack of time, word limits and the availability of equity data in primary research. This study has been the first to 'road-test' the new PRISMA-E 2012 reporting guideline and the findings are encouraging. They confirm the acceptability and potential utility of the guideline to assist review authors in reporting on equity in their reviews. The uptake and impact of PRISMA-E 2012 over time on design, conduct and reporting of primary research and systematic reviews should continue to be examined.","[Burford, Belinda J.; Waters, Elizabeth] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Sch Populat & Global Hlth, Cochrane Publ Hlth Grp, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Burford, Belinda J.; Waters, Elizabeth] Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Sch Populat & Global Hlth, Jack Brockhoff Child Hlth & Wellbeing Program, Melbourne, Vic, Australia; [Welch, Vivian; Tugwell, Peter; O'Neill, Jennifer] Univ Ottawa, Ottawa Hosp Res Inst, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Welch, Vivian] Univ Ottawa, Elizabeth Bruyere Res Inst, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Moher, David] Ottawa Hosp Res Inst, Clin Epidemiol Program, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Moher, David] Univ Ottawa, Dept Epidemiol & Community Med, Ottawa, ON, Canada; [Koehlmoos, Tracey] Int Ctr Diarrhoeal Dis Res ICDDRB, Ctr Equ & Hlth Syst, Dhaka, Bangladesh; [Petticrew, Mark] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Social & Environm Hlth Res, London WC1, England",University of Melbourne; University of Melbourne; University of Ottawa; Ottawa Hospital Research Institute; University of Ottawa; University of Ottawa; Ottawa Hospital Research Institute; University of Ottawa; International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research (ICDDR); University of London; London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine,"Burford, BJ (corresponding author), Univ Melbourne, Melbourne Sch Populat & Global Hlth, Cochrane Publ Hlth Grp, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.",belinda@burford.co,"Petticrew, Mark/AAY-6274-2021; Moher, David/I-3408-2019; Welch, Vivian/AAD-9338-2020; Tugwell, Peter/AFD-8076-2022","Koehlmoos, Tracey/0000-0003-1377-8615; Moher, David/0000-0003-2434-4206; Welch, Vivian/0000-0002-5238-7097; Tugwell, Peter/0000-0001-5062-0556","Australian National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC); Victorian Health Promotion Foundation (VicHealth); Canadian Institutes of Health Research [Planning Grant - Knowledge Translation Branch of CIHR] [KPE - 114370, 248168]; Rockefeller Foundation; Jack Brockhoff Foundation; University Research Chair",Australian National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC)(National Health & Medical Research Council (NHMRC) of Australia); Victorian Health Promotion Foundation (VicHealth); Canadian Institutes of Health Research [Planning Grant - Knowledge Translation Branch of CIHR](Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR)); Rockefeller Foundation; Jack Brockhoff Foundation; University Research Chair,"Belinda Burford as part of the Cochrane Public Health Group received funding support from the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) and the Victorian Health Promotion Foundation (VicHealth).

As the European population ages and the number of cancer deaths annually increases, there is an urgent requirement to provide high-quality, effective care. The measurement of outcomes in advanced disease is complex, and to conduct comparative research and meta-analyses, appropriate tool selection is essential. Objectives. This study aimed to identify the outcome tools currently in use in end-of-life care (both clinically and for research) across Europe and investigate the preferred features of outcome tools from the perspective of those who select and apply them. Methods. A pan-European Internet-based survey of tool users was conducted in research and clinical populations. Respondents were asked to identify the tools they are using and describe ideal features of the measures. The study was conducted in accordance with guidance for best practice in web-based research. Results. Of the 311 participants who completed a survey, 99 tools in clinical care and audit, and 94 in research, were cited by less than 10 participants. Further data revealed that respondents require the number of potential tools to be rationalized and that brief tools are favored. Conclusion. The selection of valid and appropriate tools for palliative care populations requires expert guidance and support to ensure that clinicians and researchers are collecting data that have validity and potential for comparison within and between populations and countries.

Haase; MKH,VISUAL-ACUITY TEST; AUTOMATIC-MEASUREMENT; FIXATION DISPARITY; HETEROPHORIA; MICROTROPIA,"Background: The Measuring and Correcting Methodology after H.-J. Haase is based on the assumption that a minute deviation from the orthovergence position (fixation disparity) indicates a difficulty to overcome a larger vergence angle of rest. Objective recordings have, however, revealed that the subjective tests applied in the Measuring and Correcting Methodology after H.-J. Haase can mislead to the assumption of a fixation disparity, although both eyes are aligned exactly to the fixation point. Question: How do patients with an inconspicuously small, yet objectively verified strabismus react to the Measuring and Correcting Methodology by H.-J. Haase? Methods: Eight patients with a microesotropia between 0.5 and 3 degrees were subjected to the Measuring and Correcting Methodology after H.-J. Haase. Results: In all 8 patients, the prisms determined with the Cross-, Pointer- and Rectangle Tests increased the angle of squint, without reaching a full correction: the original angle prevailed. In the Stereobalance Test, prisms did not reduce the 100% preponderance of the non-squinting eye. The stereoscopic threshold was between 36 and 1170 arcsec in 7 out of the 8 subjects, and above 4000 arcsec in 1 subject. Conclusions: (1) In all 8 patients, prisms determined with the Measuring and Correcting Methodology by H.-J. Haase increased the angle of strabismus, without reaching bifoveal vision. This uniform result suggests that primary microesotropia cannot be corrected with the Measuring and Correcting Methodology after H.-J. Haase (2) A lacking contribution of the strabismic eye to the recognition of a lateral off-set between stereo objects, as determined with the Stereobalance Test, does not imply a lack of binocular stereopsis.","Univ Freiburg, Augenklin, Sekt Neuroophthalmol Kinderophthalmol & Schielbeh, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany",University of Freiburg,"Kromeier, M (corresponding author), Univ Freiburg, Augenklin, Sekt Neuroophthalmol Kinderophthalmol & Schielbeh, Killianstr 5, D-79106 Freiburg, Germany.",Miriam.Kromeier@uniklinik-freiburg.de,,,,,,,26,2,2,0,5,GEORG THIEME VERLAG KG,STUTTGART,"RUDIGERSTR 14, D-70469 STUTTGART, GERMANY",0023-2165,,,KLIN MONATSBL AUGENH,Klinische Monatsblat.

A side channel carries spatially varied flow with increasing discharge and the water surface profiles within the channel are a main feature of the design process. Usually, the bottom width of the channel is flared in the flow direction. An end sill is also installed at the downstream end of the structure to act as a control section and to provide a desirable flow condition within the channel. In this paper, the results of an experimental program to study the impact of installing such an end sill on flow characteristics in a non-prismatic side channel are presented. Six distinct longitudinal profiles were clearly observed in each experimental run. Two of these profiles comprise the line of the highest and the lowest points of the water surface elevation along the channel. The difference between the heights of these lines was used as a mean to assess the sill effects on the flow characteristics, the 3D water surface, and the energy dissipation of the incoming flow. The results indicated that the difference between the selected longitudinal profiles could be evaluated based on the critical flow depth generated on the end sill installed at the downstream end of the channel. Hence, based on an envelope drawn to the data, a method was proposed to determine the maximum potential impact that an end sill might have on the flow depth, which could be considered as a guideline in the design process.

Due to the complexity of nonprismatic geometry, the application domain has been mostly limited to prismatic workpiece fixturing. Moreover, based on the 3-2-1 locating principle, the locators employed are mostly restricted to the cylindrical type. This research focuses on another type of fixture configuration for non-prismatic parts that has been mostly overlooked. This is to apply V-blocks in workholding to ensure stable and efficient work setup of non-prismatic parts. The algorithm presented in this paper determines V-block locating by utilising projected geometric reasoning. The major steps of the algorithm include candidate-point generation, angle and distance checking, co-ordinate transformation, and interference analysis. Further more, this paper also explores another algorithm for determining the corresponding clamping location of the V-block. The horizontal clamp is planned based on static principles. To ensure workpiece stability, the planning procedure is classified into three distinct cases according to the force distribution and frictional conditions at the contacting regions. These two algorithms, V-block locating and clamp planning, are applied interactively to obtain the most desired fixture configuration. Finally, an example is provided to explain how these algorithms are applied.",,,"Hou, JL (corresponding author), NATL TSING HUA UNIV,DEPT IND ENGN,HSINCHU,TAIWAN.",,"Trappey, Amy/KWV-0368-2024",,,,,,30,8,10,0,12,INDERSCIENCE ENTERPRISES LTD,GENEVA AEROPORT,"WORLD TRADE CENTER BLDG 110 AVE LOUIS CASAI CP 306, CH-1215 GENEVA AEROPORT, SWITZERLAND",0952-8091,,,INT J COMPUT APPL T,Int.

It is then applied to derive a quadratic yield equation for the case of prismatic monoclinic symmetry, which is induced by simple shear deformation. This new criterion dan in turn be approximated by an orthotropic one by choosing the 'best' symmetry axes. The above equations are then used to derive the angular dependences of the uniaxial yield stress and strain rate ratio in the plane of a prismatic monoclinic sheet. Finally, it is shown on an example that they are able to predict the axial stresses occurring during torsion testing with a fairly good accuracy.
