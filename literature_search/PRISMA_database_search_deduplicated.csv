rayyan-108684001,Prevalence of Temporomandibular Disorders in Orthognathic Surgery patients: A systematic review conducted according to PRISMA guidelines and the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions,2023,1,1,,0305182X,50,10,,Abdul N.S. and Minervini G.,NA,,John Wiley and Sons Inc,,"Background: Orthognathic surgery is done to treat a variety of dentofacial abnormalities, but a wide gap still remains on how it can result in temporomandibular joint dysfunction (TMD). The primary goal of this review was to assess the effects of various orthognathic surgical techniques on the emergence or exacerbation of TMJ dysfunction. Methods: A comprehensive search was conducted across several databases using Boolean operators and MeSH keywords related to temporomandibular joint disorders (TMDs) and orthognathic surgical interventions, with no limitation on the year of publication. Two independent reviewers screened the identified studies based on predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria, followed by a risk of bias assessment using a standardised tool. Results: Five articles were considered for inclusion in this review. A greater number of females opted for surgical options than their male cohorts. Three studies were of prospective design, 1 of retrospective and 1 of observational type. Mobility on lateral excursion, tenderness on palpation, arthralgia and popping sounds were the TMD characteristics that showed significant differences. Overall, orthognathic surgical intervention did not show an increase in TMD signs and symptoms as compared to nonsurgical counterparts. Conclusion: Though orthognathic surgery reported greater cases of some TMD symptoms and signs as compared to the nonsurgical cohorts in four studies, the conclusive evidence is debatable. Further studies are recommended with a longer follow-up period and greater sample size to determine the impact of orthognathic surgery on TMJ. © 2023 The Authors.

The objective of this study is to systematically evaluate the effects of art therapy on schizophrenia and to determine whether there are some potential influencing factors affecting the effects of art therapy. Methods: Seven online databases will be searched from their inception until June 30, 2022. All the relevant randomized clinical trials (RCTs) comparing art therapy plus standardized treatment versus standardized treatment alone for schizophrenia will be selected and assessed for inclusion. The Cochrane risk-of-bias tool will be used to evaluate the methodological quality of the included RCTs. Review Manager 5.4 will be used to analyze all the data obtained. Mental health symptoms are defined as the primary outcome, and the secondary outcomes include the Global Assessment of Functioning score, quality of life, functional remission, and the level of self-esteem. Subgroup analyses will be performed based on the type of schizophrenia, severity of schizophrenia, type of art therapy, follow-up duration, or different populations. Results: The results will be published in a peer-reviewed journal. Conclusions: This updated systematic review and subgroup meta-analysis will evaluate the effects of art therapy as adjunctive treatment to standardized treatment in patients with schizophrenia and determine whether there are some potential confounding variables affecting the effects of art therapy on the outcomes of schizophrenia patients, thus strengthening the evidence base for the clinical application of this combination therapy for schizophrenia.  © 2022 the Author(s).

In this era, the digital reputation of a company is one of the most important factors for its success. Today, consumers are more often referring to online reviews and the information they can find on social networks before making a purchase decision. With this background, the possibilities that artificial intelligence can offer as an innovative solution to monitor and improve digital reputation are highly appreciated. Thus, in this paper, we will discuss how artificial intelligence plays a role in managing a company’s digital reputation and what benefits it may contribute. In the age of the digital revolution, online image and reputation have evolved into an asset that has no alternative for both individuals and companies. Every minute, millions of people are involved in online interactions, and those actions leave a trace that could greatly affect how people perceive them. In this context, using AI applications to manage and control reputations is indeed quite new and completely revolutionizes the concept of what we traditionally understood as reputation management in the digital space. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",,10.1007/978-3-031-67431-0_48,,NA,NA,a role of artificial intelligence in online reputation management a systematic literature review using prisma methodology

rayyan-108684005,Clinically Important Deterioration (CID) and Ageing in COPD: A Systematic Review and Meta-Regression Analysis According to PRISMA Statement,2023,1,1,,11769106,18,NA,,Manzetti G.M. and Ora J. and Sepiacci A. and Cazzola M. and Rogliani P. and Calzetta L.,NA,,Dove Medical Press Ltd,,"Purpose: Clinically important deterioration (CID) is a composite endpoint developed to quantify the impact of pharmacological treatment in clinical trials for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), also showing a prognostic value. CID is defined as any of the following condition: forced expiratory volume in 1 s decrease ≥100 mL from baseline, and/or St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire total score increase ≥4-unit from baseline, and/or the occurrence of a moderate-to-severe exacerbation of COPD. Although most COPD patients experience a clinical worsening as they get older, to date, no specific studies assessed the correlation between ageing and CID in COPD. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the impact of ageing on CID in COPD patients. Patients and Methods: Data obtained from 55219 COPD patients were extracted from 17 papers, mostly post-hoc analyses. A pairwise meta-analysis and a meta-regression analysis were performed according to PRISMA-P guidelines to quantify the impact of pharmacological therapy on CID and to determine whether ageing might modulate the risk of CID in COPD patients. Results: Inhaled treatments resulted generally effective in reducing the risk of CID in COPD (relative risk: 0.81, 95% confidence interval 0.79–0.84; P < 0.001). The meta-regression analysis indicated a trend toward significance (P = 0.063) in the linear relationship between age and the risk of CID. Of note, age significantly (P < 0.05) increased the risk of CID when associated with lower post-bronchodilator FEV1. These results were not affected by a significant risk of bias. Conclusion: This quantitative synthesis suggests that inhaled therapy is effective in reducing the risk of CID in COPD, although such a protective effect may be affected in older patients with impaired lung function. Further studies specifically designed on CID in COPD are needed to confirm these results. © 2023 Manzetti et al. This work is published and licensed by Dove Medical Press Limited.

Method: The difference in risk of immune-associated pneumonitis between PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors was assessed by two different meta-analysis methods, the Mirror-pairing and the PRISMA guidelines. Results: A total of eighty-eight reports were used for meta-analysis, while thirty-two studies were used for the Mirror-pairing. Both PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors (used alone or combined with chemotherapy) increased the risk of developing immune-related pneumonitis (P < 0.00001; P < 0.00001). Based on indirect analyses results (subgroup analyses), the risk of PD-L1-induced pneumonitis was weaker than that of PD-1 inhibitors when the control group was chemotherapy (OR = 3.33 vs. 5.43) or placebo (OR = 2.53 vs. 3.19), while no obvious significant differences were found (P = 0.17; P = 0.53). For the Mirror-pairing-based meta-analysis, the risk of PD-1-induced pneumonitis was significantly higher than that of PD-L1 inhibitors (OR = 1.46, 95%CI [1.08, 1.98], I2 = 0%, Z = 2.47 (P = 0.01)). However, this difference was not significant, when they were combined with chemotherapy (OR = 1.05, 95%CI [0.68, 1.60], I2 = 38%, Z = 0.21 (P = 0.84)).

In recent years, there has been growing interest in understanding the relationship between bruxism and alcohol abuse, as both are prevalent issues that may share underlying factors and exacerbate each other. This systematic review, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement, aims to evaluate the frequency of bruxism among individuals with alcohol abuse. Methods: A comprehensive search of electronic databases, including PubMed, Lilacs, Scopus and Web of Science, will be conducted to identify relevant studies published up to the knowledge cutoff date in January 2023. The search strategy will include keywords related to bruxism, alcohol abuse, and their synonyms. Inclusion criteria will encompass original research studies, such as observational, cross-sectional, cohort, and case-control studies, as well as clinical trials, that examine the relationship between bruxism and alcohol abuse. Two independent reviewers will perform the study selection, data extraction, and quality assessment, with discrepancies resolved by consensus. Results: The systematic review will present a summary of the identified studies, including the study design, characteristics of the study populations, and key findings related to the association between bruxism and alcohol abuse. The potential mechanisms underlying this relationship will also be explored. Subgroup analyses and the quality of evidence will be assessed. Finally, the implications of this association for clinical practice and further research will be discussed. Conclusions: This systematic review will contribute to a better understanding of the interplay between bruxism and alcohol abuse, shedding light on potential risk factors, mechanisms, and clinical implications.

The main clinical manifestations were pulmonary congestion and decreased cardiac output. The purpose of this systematic review is to evaluate the effectiveness of Yiqi Huoxue therapy on CHF. Methods: Seven electronic databases were searched to identify randomized controlled trials of Yiqi Huoxue (YQHX) method for CHF until April 30, 2020. The quality assessment of the included trials was performed by employing the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool and Jadad scale. Results: Nineteen randomized controlled trials were included in our review. Most of the included trials were considered as low quality. The aggregated results suggested that experimental group with YQHX therapy got better effect in increasing overall response rate (risk ratio, RR = 1.21, 95% confidence interval, CI 1.15-1.27), traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) syndrome response rate (RR = 1.26, 95% CI 1.17-1.36), 6-minute walk test (RR = 2.14, 95% CI 1.05-3.22), left ventricular ejection fraction (RR = 0.97, 95% CI 0.60-1.34), and stroke volume (standardized mean difference, SMD = 0.94, 95% CI 0.23-1.56), and in lowering down the TCM syndrome scores (SMD = -0.78, 95% CI -0.91 to -0.64), Minnesota Living with Heart Failure questionnaire (SMD = -1.01, 95% CI -1.56 to -0.45), 6-month readmission rate (RR = 0.50, 95% CI 0.28-0.89), B-type natriuretic peptide (SMD = -0.89, 95% CI -1.52 to -0.25), NT-proBNP (SMD = -2.07, 95% CI -3.34 to -0.08), and C-reactive protein (SMD = -2.04, 95% CI -4.12 to -0.67) as compared to using conventional Western medicine alone. There were no significant differences found in left ventricular end diastolic diameter and E/E′ between experimental groups and control groups. Moreover, the included sample capacity is small and the trails are all in Chinese. Quality of the evidence for outcomes were ""low"" and ""very low"" according to the GRADE assessment. Conclusion: YQHX is a valid complementary and alternative therapy in the management of CHF, especially in improving overall response rate, TCM syndrome response rate, 6-minute walk test, left ventricular ejection fraction, and stroke volume and in decreasing TCM syndrome scores, Minnesota Living with Heart Failure questionnaire, 6-month readmission rate, B-type natriuretic peptide, NT-proBNP, and C-reactive protein levels. Hence, YQHX is a relatively effective and safe therapy for CHF patients, which can be popularized and applied in the clinic.

Systematic review publications have increased from a sporadic few in 1980s to more than 10,000 systematic reviews published every year and around 30,000 registered in prospective registries. Methods: A cross-sectional design and a variety of data sources were triangulated to identify the journals from which systematic reviews would be evaluated for adherence to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 reporting guidelines and scope. Specifically, this study used the PRISMA 2020 reporting guidelines to assess the reporting of the introduction, methods, information sources and search strategy, study selection process, quality/bias assessments, and results and discussion aspects of the included systematic reviews. Results: Upon review of the 215 systematic reviews published in 10 top-tier journals in the field of nursing in 2019 and 2020, this study identified several opportunities to improve the reporting of systematic reviews in the context of the 2020 PRISMA statement. Areas of priority for reporting include the following key areas: (1) information sources, (2) search strategies, (3) study selection process, (4) bias reporting, (5) explicit discussion of the implications to policy, and lastly, the need for (6) prospective protocol registration. Discussion: The use of the PRISMA 2020 guidelines by authors, peer reviewers, and editors can help to ensure the transparent and detailed reporting of systematic reviews published in the nursing literature. Clinical Relevance: Systematic reviews are considered strong research evidence that can guide evidence-based practice and even clinical decision-making. This paper addresses some common methodological and process issues among systematic reviews that can guide clinicians and practitioners to be more critical in appraising research evidence that can shape nursing practice. © 2024 Sigma Theta Tau International.",,10.1111/jnu.12969,,38553883,NA,adherence to prisma 2020 reporting guidelines and scope of systematic reviews published in nursing a crosssectional analysis

Materials and Methods: Twenty-four articles (systematic review and meta-analysis, n = 18; systematic review only, n = 6) published between August 2009 and September 2021 in the Korean Journal of Radiology were analyzed. Completeness of the reporting of main texts and abstracts were evaluated using the PRISMA 2020 statement. For each item in the statement, the proportion of studies that met the guidelines’ recommendation was calculated and items that were satisfied by fewer than 80% of the studies were identified. The review process was conducted by two independent reviewers. Results: Of the 42 items (including sub-items) in the PRISMA 2020 statement for main text, 24 were satisfied by fewer than 80% of the included articles. The 24 items were grouped into eight domains: 1) assessment of the eligibility of potential articles, 2) assessment of the risk of bias, 3) synthesis of results, 4) additional analysis of study heterogeneity, 5) assessment of non-reporting bias, 6) assessment of the certainty of evidence, 7) provision of limitations of the study, and 8) additional information, such as protocol registration. Of the 12 items in the abstract checklists, eight were incorporated in fewer than 80% of the included publications. Conclusion: Several items included in the PRISMA 2020 checklist were overlooked in systematic review and meta-analysis articles published in the Korean Journal of Radiology.

The aim of this study is to systematically assess the most prevalent clinical signs, symptoms and comorbidities of acromegaly at time of diagnosis. Design: A literature search (in PubMed, Embase and Web of Science) was performed on November 18, 2021, in collaboration with a medical information specialist. Methods: Prevalence data on (presenting) clinical signs, symptoms and comorbidities at time of diagnosis were extracted and synthesized as weighted mean prevalence. The risk of bias was assessed for each included study using the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist for Studies Reporting Prevalence Data. Results: Risk of bias and heterogeneity was high in the 124 included articles. Clinical signs and symptoms with the highest weighted mean prevalence were: acral enlargement (90%), facial features (65%), oral changes (62%), headache (59%), fatigue/tiredness (53%; including daytime sleepiness: 48%), hyperhidrosis (47%), snoring (46%), skin changes (including oily skin: 37% and thicker skin: 35%), weight gain (36%) and arthralgia (34%). Concerning comorbidities, acromegaly patients more frequently had hypertension, left ventricle hypertrophy, dia/systolic dysfunction, cardiac arrhythmias, (pre)diabetes, dyslipidemia and intestinal polyps- and malignancy than age- and sex matched controls. Noteworthy, cardiovascular comorbidity was lower in more recent studies. Features that most often led to diagnosis of acromegaly were typical physical changes (acral enlargement, facial changes and prognatism), local tumor effects (headache and visual defect), diabetes, thyroid cancer and menstrual disorders. Conclusion: Acromegaly manifests itself with typical physical changes but also leads to a wide variety of common comorbidities, emphasizing that recognition of a combination of these features is key to establishing the diagnosis. © 2023, The Author(s).",,10.1007/s11102-023-01322-7,,37210433,NA,prevalence of clinical signs symptoms and comorbidities at diagnosis of acromegaly a systematic review in accordance with prisma guidelines

Best practices for patient and public involvement (PPI) in such projects have not yet been established. We recently developed an extension of PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses), to be used for systematic reviews of outcome measurement instruments (OMIs): PRISMA-COSMIN (COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments) for OMIs 2024. Patients and public members formed a small but impactful stakeholder group. We critically evaluated the PPI component in this project and developed recommendations for conducting PPI when developing reporting guidelines. Main text: A patient partner was an integral research team member at the project development and grant application stage. Once the project started, five patient and public contributors (PPCs) were recruited to participate in the Delphi study; three PPCs contributed to subsequent steps. We collected quantitative feedback through surveys; qualitative feedback was garnered through a focus group discussion after the Delphi study and through debrief meetings after subsequent project activities. Feedback was thematically combined with reflections from the research team, and was predominantly positive. The following themes emerged: importance of PPI partnership, number of PPCs involved, onboarding, design of Delphi surveys, flexibility in the process, complexity of PPI in methodological research, and power imbalances. Impacts of PPI on the content and presentation of the reporting guideline were evident, and reciprocal learning between PPCs and the research team occurred throughout the project. Lessons learned were translated into 17 recommendations for future projects. Conclusion: Integrating PPI in the development of PRISMA-COSMIN for OMIs 2024 was feasible and considered valuable by PPCs and the research team. Our approach can be applied by others wishing to integrate PPI in developing reporting guidelines. © The Author(s) 2024.",,10.1186/s40900-024-00563-5,,NA,NA,a blueprint for patient and public involvement in the development of a reporting guideline for systematic reviews of outcome measurement instruments prismacosmin for omis 2024

The commonest title terminology was “overview of (systematic) reviews” (38/96 [40%]). Methods for handling SR overlap were reported in 24/96 (25%), methods for assessing primary study overlap in 18/96 (19%), handling of discrepant data in 11/96 (11%), and methods for methodological quality or risk of bias assessment of the primary studies within SRs in 23/96 (24%). Authors included data sharing statements in 28/96 (29%), complete funding disclosure in 43/96 (45%), protocol registration in 43/96 (45%), and conflict of interest statement in 82/96 (85%) overviews. Conclusion: Insufficient reporting was identified in methodological characteristics unique in overviews' conduct and most transparency markers. Adoption of PRIOR from the research community could ameliorate overviews’ reporting. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.",,10.1016/j.jclinepi.2023.05.018,,37245702,NA,overviews of reviews in the cardiovascular field underreported critical methodological and transparency characteristics a methodological study based on the preferred reporting items for overviews of reviews prior statement

The study was framed in the exploratory research level, using hermeneutics to analyze the systematic review developed in the databases Medline, PubMed, ScienceDirect and Google Scholar, from which 16 documents were finally included. It was shown that the main complications of laparoscopic surgery are vascular and intestinal damage, but less serious and frequent complications such as bladder and urethral damage, hernias and infections can also occur. We found that laparoscopic surgery has emerged as the preferred modality for the investigation, diagnosis and treatment of a wide range of diseases, including ovarian cystectomy. Although this form of minimally invasive surgery has numerous advantages, including a lower incidence of complications, it is not without risk.

Overview of reviews of observational studies (ie, umbrella reviews) synthesise systematic reviews with or without meta-analyses of cross-sectional, case-control and cohort studies, and may also aid in the grading of the credibility of reported associations. The number of published umbrella reviews has been increasing. Recently, a reporting guideline for overviews of reviews of healthcare interventions (Preferred Reporting Items for Overviews of Reviews (PRIOR)) was published, but the field lacks reporting guidelines for umbrella reviews of observational studies. Our aim is to develop a reporting guideline for umbrella reviews on cross-sectional, case-control and cohort studies assessing epidemiological associations. Methods and analysis We will adhere to established guidance and prepare a PRIOR extension for systematic reviews of cross-sectional, case-control and cohort studies testing epidemiological associations between an exposure and an outcome, namely Preferred Reporting Items for Umbrella Reviews of Cross-sectional, Case-control and Cohort studies (PRIUR-CCC). Step 1 will be the project launch to identify stakeholders. Step 2 will be a literature review of available guidance to conduct umbrella reviews. Step 3 will be an online Delphi study sampling 100 participants among authors and editors of umbrella reviews. Step 4 will encompass the finalisation of PRIUR-CCC statement, including a checklist, a flow diagram, explanation and elaboration document. Deliverables will be (i) identifying stakeholders to involve according to relevant expertise and end-user groups, with an equity, diversity and inclusion lens; (ii) completing a narrative review of methodological guidance on how to conduct umbrella reviews, a narrative review of methodology and reporting in published umbrella reviews and preparing an initial PRIUR-CCC checklist for Delphi study round 1; (iii) preparing a PRIUR-CCC checklist with guidance after Delphi study; (iv) publishing and disseminating PRIUR-CCC statement. Ethics and dissemination PRIUR-CCC has been approved by The Ottawa Health Science Network Research Ethics Board and has obtained consent (20220639-01H).

Many therapy options are available but are not codified. Systematic reviews (SRs) and meta-analyses (MAs) are helpful to elaborate recommendations on the management of AGWs. The objective of our study was to assess the quality and consistency of SRs for the local management of AGWs using three international tools. Methods Seven electronic databases were searched from inception to 10 January 2022 for this SR. The intervention of interest was any local treatment of AGWs. There was no restriction on language and population. The methodological quality, reporting quality and risk of bias (ROB) of the included SRs for the local treatments of AGWs were assessed independently by two investigators with A Measurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews version II (AMSTAR II), Risk of Bias in Systematic Reviews (ROBIS) and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA). Results Twenty-two SRs/MAs met all inclusion criteria. According to the results of the AMSTAR II, nine included reviews were rated critically as being of low quality, and only five were of high quality. Based on the ROBIS tool, only nine SRs/MAs had a low ROB. The domain-assessed 'study eligibility criteria' were mostly rated at a low ROB, unlike the other domains. With PRISMA, the reporting checklist was relatively complete for ten SRs/MAs, but some reporting weaknesses remained in the topics of the abstract, protocol and registration, ROB and funding. Discussion Several therapy options are available for the local management of AGWs and are widely studied. However, due to the many ROB and low quality of these SRs/MAs, only a few of them have the sufficient methodological quality to support guidelines.

Determined actors inside and outside the industry have identified key environmental concerns, such as energy efficiency or recycling, that support promoting a sustainable industry. To explore how sustainability is implemented in the wine sector, we, the authors of this paper, conducted a systematic literature review methodology. The PRISMA model served as our primary criteria for focusing the literature search and was utilized in its execution. Our study analyses thirty scholarly publications, which are categorized according to three primary themes: (1) Wineries and Sustainability; (2) Wineries and Cognitive Biases; and (3) Wineries and Sustainability and Cognitive Biases. The novelty of the study lies in its use of a systematic literature review (SLR) to investigate the complex interaction between wine, cognitive biases, and sustainability with a combined focus. The findings point to the understudied domain of consumers' cognitive biases regarding alternate wine packaging. Our results show that there is potential for improvement in the wine sector in terms of sustainable packaging and the consumer behavior of accepting or rejecting specific packaging options. These areas are considered worthy of future holistic approach investigation because alternative packaging is critical to making the industry more environmentally friendly. Still, if consumers cannot accept and purchase wine thus packaged, such raises further questions.

This study sought to examine these relationships in the context of colorectal cancer (CRC). A comprehensive search of relevant studies was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 guidelines and the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. The studies included a variety of treatment modalities and microbiological parameters. A data extraction form, designed specifically for this review, was used to assess a range of variables across all studies. The analysis revealed a multifaceted interaction between the gut microbiota, genetic factors and treatment outcomes. Elderly patients with CRC frequently received single-agent chemotherapy, with outcomes that were comparable to those of younger patients. The presence of tumorigenic bacteria, including Escherichia coli and Bacteroides fragilis, was associated with early colon neoplasia. Additionally, an abundance of Fusobacterium spp. was observed in colonic adenomas, contributing to a pro-inflammatory environment. Although the FcγRIIIa-158 V/V genotype was associated with higher cetuximab-mediated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), no direct influence of FcγR polymorphisms on treatment response was noted. Furthermore, the combination of programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1), BRAF and MEK inhibition showed favorable response rates. The gut microbiome, especially the presence of Fusobacterium spp., had a notable influence on the therapeutic response in CRC. These findings underscore the role of the gut microbiota and genetic factors in cancer treatment outcomes, emphasizing the potential of a holistic approach to cancer management.

A potential means to address the replication crisis and enhance research reliability is to improve reporting quality and transparency. This study aims to formulate a reporting checklist as a supplement to the existing reporting guidelines, specifically for resistance exercise studies. Methods: PubMed (which covers Medline) and Scopus (which covers Medline, EMBASE, Ei Compendex, World Textile Index, Fluidex, Geobase, Biobase, and most journals in Web of Science) were searched for systematic reviews that comprised the primary studies directly comparing different resistance training methods. Basic data on the selected reviews, including on authors, publication years, and objectives, were summarized. The reporting items for the checklist were identified based on the objective of the reviews. Additional items from an existing checklist, namely the Consensus on Exercise Reporting Template, a National Strength and Conditioning Association handbook, and an article from the EQUATOR library were incorporated into the final reporting checklist. Results: Our database search retrieved 3595 relevant records. After automatic duplicate removal, the titles and abstracts of the remaining 2254 records were screened. The full texts of 137 records were then reviewed, and 88 systematic reviews that met the criteria were included in the umbrella review. Conclusion: Developed primarily by an umbrella review method, this checklist covers the research questions which have been systematically studied and is expected to improve the reporting completeness of future resistance exercise studies. The PRIRES checklist comprises 26 reporting items (39 subitems) that cover four major topics in resistance exercise intervention: 1) exercise selection, performance, and training parameters, 2) training program and progression, 3) exercise setting, and 4) planned vs actual training.

However, there is little international literature on large-scale empirical studies that place this methodological approach in a relevant position to guarantee the efficacy of PCP. The main objective of this study is to know the status of the use of PCP methodology through empirically supported studies that sustain both benefits and limitations during the last 10 years (2012-2022). For this purpose, a systematic review has been conducted since the PrIsMA guidelines (2020), including a total of 31 articles. As a conclusion, more benefits than limitations have been found, among which the advantages in its use for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities and improvements in aspects related to self-determination stand out. However, limitations prevail due to the lack of adequate support and resources from organizations to respond to person-centered planning and the need for training of the people involved in the development of the PCP, which raises the question of whether good practices are being carried out in the use of this methodology. © 2023 University of Salamanca.

TMD is a multifactorial condition characterised by pain and dysfunction in the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) and surrounding structures. Salivary biomarkers have emerged as potential diagnostic tools due to their non-invasiveness and easy accessibility. However, the literature on salivary biomarkers in relation to TMD is limited and inconsistent. Methods: Electronic databases of Pubmed, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, Cochrane Library, PsychINFO, CINAHL and Medline were searched using specific search terms and Boolean operators. The search was limited to articles published in English that assessed salivary biomarkers in individuals diagnosed with TMD. Two reviewers independently screened the articles and extracted data. ROB-2 was used to assess the risk of bias. Results: Eleven clinical papers met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. The findings provided consistent evidence of a clear association between salivary biomarkers and TMD. Various biomarkers, including cortisol, IL-1, glutamate and several others, were assessed. Some studies reported higher levels of cortisol and IL-1 in TMD patients, indicating potential involvement in stress and inflammation. Glutamate levels were found to be elevated, suggesting a role in pain modulation. Other biomarkers also showed alterations in TMD patients compared to controls:. Conclusion: The findings from the included studies suggest that salivary biomarkers may play a role in TMD pathophysiology. Though a definitive conclusion can be drawn regarding the specific salivary biomarkers and their association with TMD, the results must be interpreted with caution considering the heterogeneity of the biomarkers assessed. Further research with larger sample sizes, standardised methodology and rigorous study designs is needed to elucidate the role of salivary biomarkers in TMD. © 2023 The Authors.

Several types of biomass heat treatment methods have been introduced to obtain useful byproducts via pyrolysis. Microwaves are a practical replacement for conventional stoves and ovens to perform pyrolysis of biomass. Their rapid heating rate and user-friendliness make them a good choice for the pyrolysis process over conventional methods. The current study reviewed research articles that used microwaves for the pyrolysis process on different types of biomass. This study primarily provides comprehensive details about the pyrolysis process, especially microwave-assisted pyrolysis (MAP) and its feasibility for treating biomass. A systematic literature review, according to the PRISMA guidelines, was performed to find research articles on biomass treatment using MAP technology. We analyzed various research studies (n = 32), retrieved from different databases, that used MAP for pyrolysis on various types of biomass, and we achieved good results. The main goal of this study was to examine the usefulness of the MAP technique, comparing its effects on distinguished types of biomass. We found MAP’s effective parameters, namely, temperature, concentration of microwave absorber, moisture percentage of starting material and flow rate, microwave power and residence time of the initial sweep gas that control the pyrolysis process, and effect quality of byproducts. The catalytic agent in MAP pyrolysis was found to be useful for treating biomass, and that it has great potential to increase (nearly double) the production yield. Although MAP could not be used for all types of materials due to some challenges, it produced good results compared to conventional heating (pyrolysis) methods. We concluded that MAP is an effective method for reducing pyrolysis reaction time and improving the quality of value-added products. Also, MAP eliminates the shredding requirement for biomass and improves heating quality. Therefore, it is a viable method for reducing pyrolysis processing costs and should be applied on a larger scale than lab scale for commercialization. © 2023 by the authors.",,10.3390/molecules28145551,,37513422,NA,a systematic review on biomass treatment using microwaveassisted pyrolysis under prisma guidelines

This article describes the development of an extension of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 guideline: PRISMA-COSMIN for OMIs 2024. Methods: The development process followed the Enhancing the QUAlity and Transparency Of health Research (EQUATOR) guidelines and included a literature search, expert consultations, a Delphi study, a hybrid workgroup meeting, pilot testing, and an end-of-project meeting, with integrated patient/public involvement. Results: From the literature and expert consultation, 49 potentially relevant reporting items were identified. Round 1 of the Delphi study was completed by 103 panelists, whereas round 2 and 3 were completed by 78 panelists. After 3 rounds, agreement (≥ 67%) on inclusion and wording was reached for 44 items. Eleven items without consensus for inclusion and/or wording were discussed at a workgroup meeting attended by 24 participants. Agreement was reached for the inclusion and wording of 10 items, and the deletion of 1 item. Pilot testing with 65 authors of OMI systematic reviews further improved the guideline through minor changes in wording and structure, finalized during the end-of-project meeting. The final checklist to facilitate the reporting of full systematic review reports contains 54 (sub)items addressing the review’s title, abstract, plain language summary, open science, introduction, methods, results, and discussion. Thirteen items pertaining to the title and abstract are also included in a separate abstract checklist, guiding authors in reporting for example conference abstracts. Conclusion: PRISMA-COSMIN for OMIs 2024 consists of two checklists (full reports; abstracts), their corresponding explanation and elaboration documents detailing the rationale and examples for each item, and a data flow diagram. PRISMA-COSMIN for OMIs 2024 can improve the reporting of systematic reviews of OMIs, fostering their reproducibility and allowing end-users to appraise the quality of OMIs and select the most appropriate OMI for a specific application.

In addition to addressing waste disposal difficulties, the inclusion of waste additives may improve the characteristics of compressed earth blocks (CEBs). This article attempts to outline the findings of researchers who have utilized the various manufacturing processes and investigated the influence of binders and fibers on the properties of CEBs. A systematic search of Web of Science and Scopus electronic databases for works on soil blocks published between 2012 and 2022 yielded 445 articles, while reports, case studies, conference papers, and non-English articles were omitted. Keywords such as “Soil blocks”, “Earth bricks”, and others were used to identify eligible studies. This study has been segmented into five sections, including a descriptive examination of articles and authors who have investigated soil blocks, a comparative analysis based on their manufacturing processes, and physical, mechanical, and durability aspects of the CSEBs, which were analyzed to determine the impact of additives. The PRISMA 2020 standards were followed in the evaluation of each record, which resulted in the identification of 61 articles that were pertinent to the study’s objective. The comparative analysis of the articles reveals that the binders were more significant in improving the compressive strength, cyclic wetting-drying and erosion (durability) aspects of the soil blocks, while fibers were effective in enhancing their flexural and thermal performance. The literature review indicates that if the minimum permissible limits are met, waste materials have the potential to partially replace the soil. In addition, this study suggests establishing standardized manufacturing norms and testing protocols to ascertain the quality and safety of CSEBs used in construction. However, this study is constrained by the limited databases used, governed by keywords, electronic resources and timeframe that could be used as research avenues in the future. © 2023 by the authors.",,10.3390/su15129374,,NA,NA,building a sustainable future from theory to practice a comprehensive prismaguided assessment of compressed stabilized earth blocks cseb for construction applications

However, we have identified several issues that point to an over-reliance on the PRISMA guidelines. Firstly, we question the rigor of implementation by authors and the rigor of verification by peer reviewers and editors, and whether they have screened papers to ensure adherence to the PRISMA guidelines. Secondly, we have identified cases where the PRISMA criteria led to as much as 99.97% of the published literature being ignored, suggesting that valid publications meeting these criteria might be at risk of being ignored. Thirdly, we have noted that exclusion is not only a quantitative problem—it is also a qualitative one, since the screening procedure groups all non-conforming literature into one basket. Fourthly, we have noted that seven copies of the PRISMA guidelines exist. This being the case, which one should be cited? To replace over-reliance on PRISMA screening, we encourage authors, peer reviewers, and editors to publish systematic reviews and meta-analyses that respect the dual criteria of scientific plausibility and diversity of included papers.

Study Design and Setting: We randomly sampled 50 publications of systematic review protocols indexed in PubMed and 50 protocols uploaded to the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) from 2016 onward. Two authors independently extracted data and assessed adherence to the 26 items specified by PRISMA-P. For each protocol, we categorized adherence to PRISMA-P as complete (≥90% of PRISMA-P items were fully reported) or partial (≥60% of PRISMA-P items were fully reported). We also assessed adherence to each PRISMA-P item across the protocols. Results: Four (8%) of the PubMed-indexed protocols adhered completely and 45 (90%) adhered partially to PRISMA-P but with considerable variation. None (0%) of the PROSPERO-uploaded protocols adhered completely and only 6 (12%) adhered partially to PRISMA-P. For both types of protocols, aspects related to the role of the sponsor, procedures for doing qualitative data synthesis if quantitative synthesis is not appropriate, and methods for assessing publication or outcome reporting biases and confidence in cumulative evidence were often not reported. Conclusion: Adherence to the PRISMA-P reporting guideline was somewhat inadequate in PubMed-indexed protocols and clearly inadequate in PROSPERO-uploaded protocols.

While existing guidelines emphasize evidence-based treatments, the potential therapeutic role of thermal water (TW) inhalation remains under-investigated. Methods: This systematic review followed PRISMA-P guidelines and sought to evaluate the impact of TW in asthma and COPD. A thorough literature search, performed up to May 2023, encompassed in vitro, in vivo, randomized controlled trial (RCT), non-RCT, and observational studies. Results: The review included 12 studies reporting different findings. In vitro studies suggested TW could enhance antioxidant capacity and cell proliferation. In a murine model of non-atopic asthma, TW inhalation reduced airway hyperresponsiveness and inflammation. RCTs in COPD patients indicated mixed effects, including improved quality of life, reduced airway oxidant stress, and enhanced exercise tolerance. Asthma patients exposed to water aerosols exhibited improved lung function and reduced airway inflammation. Non-RCTs showed improved lung function and antioxidant activity after TW therapy. Additionally, observational studies reported enhanced lung function and reduced airway inflammation. Conclusion: The current evidence suggests potential benefits of TW therapy in asthma and COPD. However, limited high-quality RCTs and concerns regarding occupational TW exposure necessitate further investigation.

However, the impact of diabetes mellitus (DM) on the periapical healing (PH) outcome in diabetic patients remains somewhat unclear. This review aimed to evaluate the PH outcome following endodontic intervention among DM-afflicted individuals. Methods: A comprehensive search was conducted across multiple electronic databases to identify relevant studies. Specifically, a set of selection criteria was applied to select studies that assessed PH outcomes in individuals with DM who underwent different treatment protocols. Data extraction and quality assessment were performed following predetermined protocols. The risk of bias (RoB) 2 assessment tool evaluated the quality of the included studies. Results: A total of 11 studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the investigation. Four studies showed a higher incidence of apical periodontitis in diabetic individuals compared to controls, and five studies reported reduced healing and success rates in this group. Overall, nine studies have shown that DM has a negative impact on periapical outcomes. This suggests that DM is an important factor in the prognosis of endodontic intervention. The assessment tools used were PAI, PR, SC, and FD analysis. RoB-2 assessed the included studies as having a moderate RoB. Conclusion: This review provides compelling evidence that DM patients experienced a noticeable negative impact on PH outcomes compared to the control population. These findings highlight the importance of considering the diabetic status of patients when assessing the prognosis of periapical diseases and planning interventions for NEI.

Pedagogical practices in physical education are specifically addressed, as well as other scenarios where strategies for teaching this subject were applied. The review is based on the consultation of the Web of Science and Scopus-Elsevier databases, covering the last five years (2019-2023) in South America. From this review, articles were selected that detail training experiences aimed at stimulating pedagogical practices in various educational environments and levels. Systematic reviews were identified focusing on specific aspects such as training in values, reflective practices in evaluation and other contributions related to physical education. In terms of methodology, qualitative approaches prevailed, with the interview being the main instrument for collecting information. On the other hand, in quantitative methodologies, questionnaires (especially the Likert scale in the evaluation of competencies and self-efficacy) were the most used. The results obtained position Chile as a leader in research on this topic in the region. In conclusion, a trend is observed that indicates that the emphasis on the qualification of the teacher's pedagogical practices in physical education focuses mainly on their professional performance.

rayyan-108684053,Evidence-based decision-making: On the use of systematicity cases to check the compliance of reviews with reporting guidelines such as PRISMA 2020,2023,1,1,,9574174,217,NA,,Boaye Belle A. and Zhao Y.,NA,,Elsevier Ltd,,"Background and context: Systematic reviews aim to provide high-quality evidence-based syntheses for efficacy under real-world conditions and allow understanding the correlations between exposures and outcomes. They are increasingly popular and have several stakeholders (e.g., healthcare providers, researchers, educators, students, journal editors, policy makers, managers) to whom they help make informed recommendations for practice or policy. Problem: Systematic reviews usually exhibit low methodological and reporting quality. To tackle this, reporting guidelines have been developed to support systematic reviews reporting and assessment. Following such guidelines is crucial to ensure that a review is transparent, complete, trustworthy, reproducible, and unbiased. However, systematic reviewers usually fail to adhere to existing reporting guidelines, which may significantly decrease the quality of the reviews they report and may result in systematic reviews that lack methodological rigor, yield low-credible findings and may mislead decision-makers. Methods: To assure that a review complies with reporting guidelines, we rely on assurance cases that are an emerging way of arguing and relaying various safety–critical systems’ requirements in an extensive manner, as well as checking the compliance of such systems with standards to support their certification. Since the nature of assurance cases makes them applicable to various domains and requirements/properties, we therefore propose a new type of assurance cases called systematicity cases. Systematicity cases focus on the systematicity property and allow arguing that a review is systematic i.e., that it sufficiently complies with the targeted reporting guideline. The most widespread reporting guidelines include PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and meta-Analyses). We measure the confidence in a systematicity case representing a review as a means to quantify the systematicity of that review i.e., the extent to which that review is systematic. We rely on rule-based Artificial Intelligence to create a knowledge-based system that automatically supports the inference mechanism that a given systematicity case embodies and that allows making a decision regarding the systematicity of a given review. Results: An empirical evaluation performed on 25 reviews (self-identifying as systematic) showed that these reviews exhibit a suboptimal systematicity. More specifically, the systematicity of the analyzed reviews varies between 32.96% and 66.49% and its average is 54.42%. More efforts are therefore needed to report systematic reviews of higher quality. More experiments are also needed to further explore the factors hindering and/or assuring the systematicity of reviews.

This could potentially contribute to the development or exacerbation of TMD symptoms. The literature on the long-term impact of MAD treated for OSA on TMD is scarce. Hence, this review was undertaken to ascertain the occurrence of TMD in MAD users. Methods: A comprehensive search protocol was implemented across several online databases using MeSH keywords and Boolean operators. A standardised data extraction form was developed specifically for this review. Two reviewers independently extracted the data. RoB-2 was used to evaluate the methodological quality of the included studies. Results: A total of 13 clinical studies were selected for this review. Some studies reported a significant reduction in the severity and frequency of TMD symptoms following MAD treatment. However, other studies did not observe significant changes in TMD symptoms or TMJ-related parameters from baseline to follow-up intervals. Temporary increases in TMJ-related pain or symptoms at the beginning of the follow-up period, which later subsided, were reported in some studies. Overall, MAD was not discontinued in any OSA patient due to TMDs. Conclusion: The findings reveal that different outcomes associated with TMD are affected differently by MAD treatment for OSAS. According to a few studies, MAD therapy significantly reduced the severity and frequency of TMD symptoms. Other research, however, found no appreciable modifications in TMD symptoms or TMJ-related indicators. Although the overall results point to no significant effect of MAD treatment on TMD symptoms, the disparity in results between studies highlights the need for additional studies using standardised approaches. © 2023 The Authors.

COSMIN (COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments) has developed a comprehensive and widespread guideline to conduct systematic reviews of outcome measurement instruments, but key information is often missing in published reviews. This hinders the appraisal of the quality of outcome measurement instruments, impacts the decisions of knowledge users regarding their appropriateness, and compromises reproducibility and interpretability of the reviews’ findings. To facilitate sufficient, transparent, and consistent reporting of systematic reviews of outcome measurement instruments, an extension of the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting of Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) 2020 guideline will be developed: the PRISMA-COSMIN guideline. Methods: The PRISMA-COSMIN guideline will be developed in accordance with recommendations for reporting guideline development from the EQUATOR (Enhancing the QUAlity and Transparency Of health Research) Network. First, a candidate reporting item list will be created through an environmental literature scan and expert consultations. Second, an international Delphi study will be conducted with systematic review authors, biostatisticians, epidemiologists, psychometricians/clinimetricians, reporting guideline developers, journal editors as well as patients, caregivers, and members of the public. Delphi panelists will rate candidate items for inclusion on a 5-point scale, suggest additional candidate items, and give feedback on item wording and comprehensibility. Third, the draft PRISMA-COSMIN guideline and user manual will be iteratively piloted by applying it to systematic reviews in several disease areas to assess its relevance, comprehensiveness, and comprehensibility, along with usability and user satisfaction. Fourth, a consensus meeting will be held to finalize the PRISMA-COSMIN guideline through roundtable discussions and voting. Last, a user manual will be developed and the final PRISMA-COSMIN guideline will be disseminated through publications, conferences, newsletters, and relevant websites. Additionally, relevant journals and organizations will be invited to endorse and implement PRISMA-COSMIN. Throughout the project, evaluations will take place to identify barriers and facilitators of involving patient/public partners and employing a virtual process.

Systematic reviews focusing on the effectiveness of different kinds of healthcare interventions have been widely published, but there were few guidelines for reporting safety concerns before 2016. The PRISMA harms checklist, which was published in 2016, can standardize reporting quality. Objectives. To evaluate the safety information reporting quality of oral traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) in systematic reviews before and after the PRISMA harms checklist was published and to explore factors associated with better reporting. Methods. We searched PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and Embase to identify all systematic reviews using oral TCM as interventions published before (from 2013 to 2015) and after (from 2017 to 2020) the PRISMA harms checklist was published. We used the PRISMA harms checklist to assess the quality of reporting of the safety information to included systematic reviews. Results. In total, 200 systematic reviews were sampled from eligible studies published between 2013 and 2020. Reviews from 2016 were excluded. Scores on the PRISMA harms checklist (23 items) ranged from 0 to 12. A systematic reviews published after 2016 had better reporting quality compared with studies published before 2016 with regard to the title (P=0.03), results of individual studies (P=0.016), and risk of bias across studies (P=0.043). In all included systematic reviews of our study, the state conclusion in coherence with review findings was reported adequately with the proportion of adherence at 95%; other items had a reporting proportion ranging from 0% to 57%. The four essential reporting items of the PRISMA harms checklist also had a low reporting quality ranging from 0% to 4%. Conclusions. Oral TCM systematic reviews reported inadequate safety information before and after the PRISMA harms checklist was published.

They allow to evaluate the strengths and the weaknesses of the evidence to support clinical decision-making if they are adequately reported. Little is known in the rehabilitation field about the completeness of reporting of SRs and its relationship with the risk of bias (ROB). Objectives: Primary: 1) To evaluate the completeness of reporting of systematic reviews (SRs) published in rehabilitation journals by evaluating their adherence to the PRISMA 2009 checklist, 2) To investigate the relationship between ROB and completeness of reporting. Secondary: To study the association between completeness of reporting and journals and study characteristics. Methods: A random sample of 200 SRs published between 2011 and 2020 in 68 rehabilitation journals was indexed under the “rehabilitation” category in the InCites database. Two independent reviewers evaluated adherence to the PRISMA checklist and assessed ROB using the ROBIS tool. Overall adherence and adherence to each PRISMA item and section were calculated. Regression analyses investigated the association between completeness of reporting, ROB, and other characteristics (impact factor, publication options, publication year, and study protocol registration). Results: The mean overall PRISMA adherence across the 200 studies considered was 61.4%. Regression analyses show that having a high overall ROB is a significant predictor of lower adherence (B=-7.1%; 95%CI -12.1, -2.0). Studies published in fourth quartile journals displayed a lower overall adherence (B= -7.2%; 95%CI -13.2, -1.3) than those published in first quartile journals; the overall adherence increased (B= 11.9%; 95%CI 5.9, 18.0) if the SR protocol was registered. No association between adherence, publication options, and publication year was found. Conclusion: Reporting completeness in rehabilitation SRs is suboptimal and is associated with ROB, impact factor, and study registration.

Biodiesel exhibits many advantages over conventional diesel including the possibility of being produced from renewable sources such as waste oils and fats. Specifically, waste animal fats are receiving increased attention as an alternative to vegetable oils for biodiesel production. This low-cost feedstock allows the mitigation of environmental pollution and can also improve biodiesel features by increasing cetane number and enhancing oxidative stability. Among the different technologies available for biodiesel production, supercritical processes offer important advantages over conventional catalytic transesterification in terms of process efficiency and reaction time. According to the increasing interest and number of research articles published in this field in the last years, this work focuses on the systematic review of the technology by using the Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) methodology. This work describes the state of the art of non-catalytic supercritical production of biodiesel using animal fats as a feedstock and discusses the key aspects of the process such as the type of fat used, operation variables including reaction time, temperature, solvent excess, pressure, and solvent excess, and the final properties of the synthesized biodiesel. © 2022 International Energy Initiative",,10.1016/j.esd.2022.06.004,,NA,NA,waste animal fats as feedstock for biodiesel production using noncatalytic supercritical alcohol transesterification a perspective by the prisma methodology

The aim of this study was to use the PRICE 2020 guidelines to appraise a sample of 50 case reports related to dental traumatology that were published before the guidelines were available in order to assess various parameters influencing the reporting quality. Methods: Fifty case reports published between 2015 and 2019 and related to dental traumatology were randomly selected from the PubMed database. Reports were assessed by two independent evaluators using the PRICE checklist. Each item received a score of “1” if the manuscript met all pertinent criteria, “0” if it was not reported, and “0.5” if it was reported insufficiently. “Not Applicable” (NA) was assigned to items that were irrelevant to a specific report. The estimated total PRICE score for each case report was computed by adding all the scores, with a maximum score of 47 minus any “NA” scores. Descriptive and Inferential statistics (Student's t-test and ANOVA) were used for analysis. Results: The percentage of case reports that fully met each applicable criteria ranged from 0% to 100%. The percentage of case reports partially satisfying each applicable criterion varied from 0% to 88%. There was a significant difference in scores for case reports published in journals with an impact factor compared with those without (p =.042). No significant difference was observed between the mean scores that compared the period of publication. There was no significant difference between journals that followed the CARE guidelines and those that did not. Conclusion: Several items within the PRICE 2020 guidelines were either not reported or only partially reported in case reports related to dental traumatology prior to the checklist publication. It is recommended that authors follow the PRICE 2020 guidelines to improve the overall quality of their case reports. © 2023 The Authors.

L2 learning, especially when it comes to learning some of the most spoken languages in the world, is increasingly including more and more automated methods to assess linguistics aspects and provide feedback to learners, especially on pronunciation issues. On the one hand, only a few of these systems integrate automatic speech recognition as a helping tool for pronunciation assessment. On the other hand, most of the computer-assisted language pronunciation tools focus on the segmental level of the language, providing feedback on specific phonetic pronunciation, and disregarding the suprasegmental features based on intonation, among others. The current review, based on the PRISMA methodology for systematic reviews, overviews the existing tools for L2 learning, classifying them in terms of the assessment level, (grammatical, lexical, phonetic, and prosodic), and trying the explain why so few tools are nowadays dedicated to evaluate the intonational aspect.

While several clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) related to ankle injuries have been developed by various organizations, there is a lack of critical appraisal of them. The purpose of this systematic review is to identify and critically appraise evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (EB-CPGs) related to acute ankle injuries in adults. Method: We conducted searches in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE databases, WHO, and reviewed 98 worldwide orthopedic association websites up until early 2023. Two authors independently applied the inclusion and exclusion criteria, and each evidence-based clinical practice guideline (EB-CPG) underwent independent critical appraisal of its content by all four authors using the Appraisal of Guidelines for REsearch and Evaluation (AGREE II) instrument. AGREE II scores for each domain were then calculated. Results: This review included five evidence-based clinical practice guidelines. The mean scores for all six domains were as follows: Scope and Purpose (87.8%), Stakeholder Involvement (69.2%), Rigour of Development (72.5%), Clarity of Presentation (86.9%), Applicability (45.6%), and Editorial Independence (53.3%). Conclusion: The number of EB-CPGs related to ankle injuries are limited and the overall quality of the existing evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (EB-CPGs) for ankle injuries is not strong, with three of them being outdated. However, valuable guidance related to Ottawa rules, manual therapy, cryotherapy, functional supports, early ambulation, and rehabilitation has been highlighted. Challenges remain in areas such as monitoring and/or auditing criteria, consideration of the target population’s views and preferences, and ensuring editorial independence. Future guidelines should prioritize improvements in these domains to enhance the quality and relevance of ankle injury management.

The manifestation depends on the form: in mild conditions, occasionally, vesicular-bullous lesions of the oral cavity may be present, which heal spontaneously without leaving scars. Patients following joint rupture have scars that limit food intake and restrict quality of life. This study aims to evaluate the possibility of carrying out an implant therapy and the success rate of this therapy. Methods: Until January 3, 2000, PubMed, Web of Science, and Lilacs were searched. Clinical studies were selected that considered implant therapy in patients with epidermolysis bullosa. Articles were therefore selected that addressed oral health and implant survival in patients with epidermolysis, with no differentiation between the various subtypes. A risk of bias assessment was performed through Cochrane. Results: Twenty-one studies were found after the investigation. Only five were chosen to create the current systematic study; 16 articles were skipped over. 10 papers were disregarded because they had been reviewed; 4 were ignored because they contained case studies; and two were omitted because they were not written in English. The results show that implant survival is at around 97%. Conclusions: Patients with epidermolysis bullosa can be treated with implant therapy without the risk of an increased implant failure rate.

Methods: The Arab Journal of Urology (AJU) was searched for SR/MAs published between January 2011 and 31 May 2022. SR/MAs with structured abstract and quantitative synthesis were eligible. Two reviewers simultaneously together selected the SR/MAs by title, screened the abstracts, and included those based on inclusion/exclusion criteria. Data of a range of characteristics were extracted from each SR/MAs into a spreadsheet. To gauge completeness of reporting, the PRISMA-Abstract checklist (12 items) was used to appraise the extent to which abstracts adhered to the checklist. For each abstract, we computed item, section, and overall adherence. Chi-square and t-tests compared the adherence scores. Univariate and multivariate analyses identified the abstract characteristics associated with overall adherence. Results: In total, 66 SR/MAs published during the examined period; 62 were included. Partial reporting was not uncommon. In terms of adherence to the 12 PRISMA-A items were: two items exhibited 100% adherence (title, objectives); five items had 80% to <100% adherence (interpretation, included studies, synthesis of results, eligibility criteria, and information sources); two items displayed 40% to <80% adherence (description of the effect, strengths/limitations of evidence); and three items had adherence that fell between 0% and 1.6% (risk of bias, funding/conflict of interest, registration). Multivariable regression revealed two independent predictors of overall adherence: single-country authorship (i.e. no collaboration) was associated with higher overall adherence (P = 0.046); and abstracts from South America were associated with lower overall adherence (P = 0.04). Conclusion: This study is the first to appraise abstracts of SR/MAs in urology. For high-quality abstracts, improvements are needed in the quality of reporting.

Additionally, researchers have been increasingly utilizing optimization models in sustainable supply chain management. This article presents a review of sustainable supply chain management literature and explores the utilization of optimization models in this domain. This review article critically examines sustainable supply chain management challenges and the application of optimization models to address them. This literature review uses PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-analyses) methodology. By exploring the Web of Science and Scopus databases, 86 publications published during 2014–2023 in 44 journals have been identified for conducting this review. A complete assessment of these studies concludes that the research that integrates the three dimensions of sustainability, viz. economic, environmental, and social, is limited. Future research should focus on developing a comprehensive framework that captures the three dimensions of sustainability simultaneously. This can be achieved by developing optimization models that concurrently consider economic, environmental, and social issues. In addition, future research should focus more on developing and applying stochastic models capturing uncertainties in the supply chain to design a practical and sustainable supply chain network. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.",,10.1007/s41660-024-00455-x,,NA,NA,application of optimization models in sustainable supply chain management a systematic review based on prisma guidelines

This review was designed to (a) systematically identify the evidence base of SRMA and to (b) critically appraise the quality of reporting according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Methods: Four databases were searched until August 2022 to systematically identify SRMA. PRISMA indicators were evaluated on a three-level response format to obtain an overall score operationalizing the quality of reporting (score range: 0-84). Additionally, the percentage of adherence to the PRISMA indicators was calculated. Results: Reporting quality of 23 SRMA, comprising 12 systematic reviews and 11 meta-analyses was evaluated. Quality scores ranged from 25 to 77 (M: 52.91; SD: 17.46). Results of the critical appraisal revealed deviations from the PRISMA indicators, including missing information on (a) registration of a study protocol, (b) statistical synthesis methods (c) evaluation of certainty of evidence, and (d) risk of bias assessment. Eleven (47.83%) of the SRMAs partially adhered, and twelve (52.17%) completely adhered to the PRISMA indicators. Conclusion: This first critical appraisal on the reporting quality of SRMA on treatment interventions for IUD highlights limitations of the evidence base. Inadequate reporting compromises the practical utility and validity of SRMA and may complicate ongoing efforts of consensus on evidence-based interventions for IUD. Future research should focus on sufficient and transparent reporting of the methodological approach.  © 2022 The Author(s).",,10.1556/2006.2022.00087,,36592332,NA,systematic reviews and metaanalyses of treatment interventions for internet use disorders critical analysis of the methodical quality according to the prisma guidelines

However, there is evidence of a lack of clinicians’ awareness of prostate cancer screening. This study sought to assess the recent evidence of clinicians’ knowledge, beliefs, and practice regarding opportunistic prostate cancer screening comparing urologists and generals practitioners. Methods: A systematic search was conducted in 3 online databases: MEDLINE, Web of Science and EMBASE (from January 1, 2015, to January 9th, 2023). Studies that explored clinicians’ knowledge, beliefs, and practices regarding opportunistic prostate cancer screening were included. Studies were assessed for quality reporting according to the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational studies in Epidemiology guidelines. Results: A total of 14 studies met the inclusion criteria: ten studies included primary care health professionals, three studies included urologists, and one study included both. Studies involving general practitioners showed a generally low level of awareness of the recommended uses of the test, and urologists showed a greater knowledge of clinical practice guidelines. General practitioners’ opinion of prostate-specific antigen was generally unfavourable in contrast to urologists’ who were more likely to be proactive in ordering the test. Less than half of the included studies evaluated shared-decision making in practice and 50% of clinicians surveyed implemented it. Conclusion: General practitioners had less knowledge of prostate cancer risk factors and clinical practice guidelines in the use of PSA than urologists, which makes them less likely to follow available recommendations. A need to carry out education interventions with trusted resources based on the available evidence and the current guidelines was identified.

The growing emphasis on sustainable business practices has led entrepreneurship research to identify entrepreneurship-related sustainability as a critical subfield. However, the inconsistent terminology used, such as “green entrepreneurship,” “ecopreneurship”, and “entrepreneurship” (ENP), reflects the fragmented nature of research in this area. A Systematic Literature Review on entrepreneurship-related sustainability was conducted to address this, focusing on the term “enviropreneurship” and applying PRISMA guidelines for transparency and methodological standardization. A total of 67 research articles published between 2013 and 2022 were analyzed to identify key themes and subthemes. This analysis resulted in a comprehensive definition of ENP and a cohesive research agenda for the future. The findings revealed significant shortcomings in standardized reporting procedures, highlighting the need for greater methodological openness and harmonization. To address this, the widespread adoption of PRISMA principles adapted to the specific needs of ENP research is advocated to enhance rigour, comparability, and reliability in this multidisciplinary field.

In this regard, the thermophysical properties of the batteries are key parameters for developing reliable and accurate thermal models. This study presents a new, simple, and cost-effective method for determination of heat capacity and anisotropic thermal conductivity of a commercial high energy density (43 Ah) prismatic-shape lithium-ion battery. The influence of various operating temperatures on thermal parameters is investigated. The predicted heat capacity and thermal conductivity are then used to simulate the battery cell temperature at a high current charge and discharge rate using a lumped thermal network and a three-dimensional (3D) thermal model at different environment temperatures. Additionally, the thermal behavior of a 48 V battery module consisting of 12 cells is simulated using a 3D thermal model at room temperature. Both cell and module level simulations are validated with experimental results obtained by thermocouples and a thermal camera. The thermal characterization results reveal that the heat capacity of the battery slightly increases as the operating temperature increases, while the thermal conductivity remains independent of the temperature. The comparison of simulation and experimental results indicate that the developed method in this study is a quick and practical way to accurately predict the thermophysical properties of the battery and contribute towards the thermal management of Li-ion modules and packs. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",,10.1016/j.est.2020.101707,,NA,NA,thermal modeling of a highenergy prismatic lithiumion battery cell and module based on a new thermal characterization methodology

Aidi injection plus paclitaxel-based chemotherapy is often used to in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in China. Aim of the study: The objective of this study is to further confirm whether Aidi injection can improve the tumor responses and survivals, and reveal its safety, optimal usage and combination with paclitaxel. Materials and methods: A meta-analysis was performed following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. All randomized controlled trials (RCTs) concerning the Aidi injection plus paclitaxel-based chemotherapy for NSCLC were selected. Main outcomes were objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), survivals, quality of life (QOL) and adverse drug reactions (ADRs). All data were extracted by using a standard data extraction form and synthesized through meta-analysis. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used for rating the quality of evidence. Results: Thirty-one RCTs involving 2058 patients were included, and most trials had an unclear methodological bias risk. The risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of ORR, DCR, QOL, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, gastrointestinal toxicity and liver injury were as following: 1.32 (1.20–1.46), 1.14 (1.09–1.20), 1.89 (1.66–2.16), 0.61 (0.51–0.74), 0.62 (0.45–0.87), 0.59 (0.49–0.72) and 0.52 (0.36–0.75). Compared to chemotherapy alone, all differences were statistically significant. Subgroup analysis showed that only with the TP, Aidi injection could increase the ORR and DCR. Treatment with 100 ml, 80 ml or 50 ml/time, and 14 days/2 cycles or 21 days/2–4 cycles, Aidi injection could increase the ORR and DCR, respectively. Sensitivity analysis showed that the results had good robustness. None of the trials reported the overall survivals (OS), progression free survival (PFS). The quality of evidences was moderate. Conclusions: Current moderate evidence revealed that Aidi injection plus paclitaxel-based chemotherapy, especially TP can significantly improve the clinical efficacy and QOL for patients with stage III/IV NSCLC. Aidi injection can relieve the risk of hematotoxicity, gastrointestinal toxicity and liver injury in patient with NSCLC receiving paclitaxel-based chemotherapy. The optimal usage may be 50 ml/time and 14 days/2 cycles. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",,10.1016/j.jep.2018.09.024,,30243827,NA,clinical efficacy and safety of aidi injection plus paclitaxelbased chemotherapy for advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer a metaanalysis of 31 randomized controlled trials following the prisma guidelines

Observational studies principally encompass cohort, case–control, case series and cross-sectional designs. Inadequate reporting of observational studies is likely to have a negative impact on decision-making in day-to-day clinical practice; however, no reporting guidelines have been published for observational studies in Endodontics. The aim of this project is to develop reporting guidelines for authors when creating manuscripts describing observational studies in the field of Endodontology in an attempt to improve the quality of publications. The new guidelines for observational studies will be named: ‘Preferred Reporting items for OBservational studies in Endodontics (PROBE)’. A steering committee was formed by the project leaders (PD, VN) to develop the guidelines through a five-phase consensus process. The steering committee will review and adapt items from the STrengthening the Reporting of OBservational studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) statement and the Clinical and Laboratory Images in Publications (CLIP) principles, as well as identify new items that add value to Endodontics. The steering committee will create a PROBE Delphi Group (PDG), consisting of 30 members across the globe to review and refine the draft checklist items and flowchart. The items will be assessed by the PDG on a nine-point Likert scale for relevance and inclusion. The agreed items will then be discussed by a PROBE Face-to-Face meeting group (PFMG) made up of 20 individuals to further refine the guidelines. After receiving feedback from the PFMG, the steering committee will pilot and finalize the guidelines. The approved PROBE guidelines will be disseminated through publication in relevant journals, and be presented at national and international conferences. The PROBE checklist and flowchart will be available and downloadable from the Preferred Reporting Items for study Designs in Endodontics (PRIDE) website: www.pride-endodonticguidelines.org. The PROBE steering committee encourages clinicians, researchers, editors and peer reviewers to provide feedback on the PROBE guidelines to inform the steering group when the guidelines are updated. © 2020 International Endodontic Journal.

These studies compare the relative diagnostic strength of the test or device with a reference standard, therefore, guiding clinical decisions on the reliability of the test, the need for further tests, and whether to monitor or treat a particular condition. Inadequate and incomplete reporting of diagnostic accuracy studies can disguise methodological deficiencies and ultimately result in study bias and the inability to translate research findings into daily clinical practice. The Preferred Reporting Items for Diagnostic Accuracy Studies in Endodontics (PRIDASE) guidelines are being developed in order to improve the accuracy, transparency, completeness and reproducibility of diagnostic accuracy studies in the speciality of Endodontology. The aim of this paper is to report the process used to develop the PRIDASE guidelines based on a well-established consensus process. The project leaders (PD, VN) formed a steering committee of nine members (PD, VN, PA, AF, DR, SP, CK, MP, HD) to oversee and manage the project. The PRIDASE steering committee will develop the initial draft of the PRIDASE guidelines by adapting and modifying the Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (STARD) 2015 guidelines, adding new items related specifically to the nature of Endodontics and incorporate the Clinical and Laboratory Images in Publication (CLIP) principles. The initial guidelines will consist of a series of domains and individual items and will be validated by the members of a PRIDASE Delphi Group (PDG) consisting of a minimum of 30 individuals who will evaluate independently the individual items based on two parameters: ‘clarity’ using a dichotomous scoring (yes/no) and ‘suitability’ for inclusion using a 9-point Likert Scale. The scores awarded by each member and any suggestions for improvement will be shared with the PDG to inform an iterative process that will result in a series of items that are clear and suitable for inclusion in the new PRIDASE guidelines. Once the PDG has completed its work, the steering committee will create a PRIDASE Meeting Group (PMG) of 20 individuals from around the world. Members of the PDG will be eligible to be the part of PMG. The draft guidelines and flowchart approved by the PDG will then be presented for further validation and agreement by the PMG. As a result of these discussions, the PRIDASE guidelines will be finalized and then disseminated to relevant stakeholders through publications and via the Preferred Reporting Items for study Designs in Endodontology (PRIDE) website (http://pride-endodonticguidelines.org).

This paper discusses and compares PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines for Systematic Review (SR) and PRISMA for Scoping Review (ScR) for synthesizing research on CCIs mapping. ‘A systematic review attempts to collate all empirical evidence that fits pre-specified eligibility criteria to answer a specific research question. It uses explicit, systematic methods that are selected to minimize bias, thus providing reliable findings from which conclusions can be drawn and decisions made’ (Liberati et al. 2009: 65). ScR ‘(…) follow a systematic approach to map evidence on a topic and identify main concepts, theories, sources, and knowledge gaps’ (Tricco et al. 2018: 467). After analyzing and applying the guidelines and further documentation on both protocols, the ScR revealed to be more suitable in a complex field with distinct terminologies, production contexts, methodologies and objectives. Since certain topics in SR become optional, ScR is easier to apply in fields in which methods are difficult to compare and quantify, such as the Arts and Humanities. © The authors, 2021.

The absence of precise prescription recommendations to treat arterial hypertension (HT) lead to use drugs unable to reduce blood pressure (BP) to target values. We published ATOM study, in which we found significant differences in the ability to reduce BP between the different drugs. The objective of the study was to determine the expected decrease in blood pressure with the use of commercialized doses of the drugs commonly used in the treatment of HT in clinical practice, to avoid the use of drugs or combinations that even with the best response, are unable to obtain the necessary BP decrease to reach the goal. Methods: The analysis was based on the results of the ATOM study. To convert the mean doses of the different drugs and combinations in commercialized doses, the conclusions of the study by Law et al have been applied. Results: Based on the results, two tables were drawn, one for systolic BP and the other for diastolic BP, where the doses of the different drugs and combinations are classified according to the BP decrease that can be expected from them. In order to favor the use of the tables in clinical practice, the different drugs have been grouped in intervals of 10 millimeters of mercury (mmHg) for the decrease of the systolic BP and of 5 mmHg for the diastolic BP. Conclusions: Recommendations for the use of antihypertensive treatments should not be limited to pharmacological families. They should also consider differences between drugs or specific combinations. From the data of the ATOM study we have implemented tables that express the effect of the drugs commonly used in clinical practice and that should allow the clinicians to choose with care the treatment to use.

However, the efficacy and safety of this combination therapy for advanced NSCLC remain controversial. The objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of CKI combined with PBC on patients with stage III/IV non-small cell lung cancer. Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed following the PRISMA (Preferred Reported Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis) guidelines. All randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing CKI in combination with PBC versus PBC alone were retrieved and assessed for inclusion. Analyses were performed using Review Manager 5.3 (Copenhagen: The Nordic Cochrane Centre, The Cochrane Collaboration, 2014), Comprehensive Meta-Analysis 3.0 (Biostat, Englewood, NJ, United States; 2016) and Trial Sequential Analysis software (TSA) (Copenhagen Trial Unit, Centre for Clinical Intervention Research, Copenhagen, Denmark; 2011). The disease control rate (DCR) was regarded as the primary outcome, and the objective response rate (ORR), quality of life (QOL), survival rate, and toxicities were the secondary outcomes. Results: Thirty-seven trials, recruiting 3,272 patients with stage III/IV NSCLC, were included. The results showed that, CKI combined with PBC resulted in significant improvements in DCR (RR = 1.11, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.15, P < 0.00001), ORR (RR = 1.30, 95% CI 1.20 to 1.40, P < 0.00001), QOL (RR = 1.73, 95% CI 1.55 to 1.92, P < 0.00001), 1-year survival rate (RR = 1.51, 95% CI 1.18 to 1.94, P = 0.001), and a 58% decline in the incidence of severe toxicities (RR = 0.42, 95% CI 0.37 to 0.49, P < 0.00001). Conclusions: From the available evidence, our data indicate that CKI plus platinum-based chemotherapy is more effective in improving clinical efficacy and alleviating the toxicity of chemotherapy than platinum-based chemotherapy alone in the treatment of stage III/IV NSCLC. However, considering the intrinsic limitations of the included trials, high-quality RCTs with survival outcomes are still needed to further confirm our findings. © The author(s).",,10.7150/jca.40267,,NA,NA,compound kushen injection combined with platinumbased chemotherapy for stage iiiiv nonsmall cell lung cancer a metaanalysis of 37 rcts following the prisma guidelines

Methods: PubMed was searched for abstracts published during 2010–2012 (Pre-PRISMA period) and 2017–2019 (Post-PRISMA period). Reporting quality was assessed and scored using a modified 13-item PRSIMA-A checklist. Risk ratio (RR) was used to compare the adequate reporting rate of each item between the two periods. Univariable and multivariable linear regression analyses were performed to identify factors associated with reporting quality. Results: A total of 160 abstracts were included and assessed. Only four items (‘objective’, ‘results of main outcomes’, ‘description of the effect’ and ‘interpretation’) were adequately reported in most abstracts (>75 %). According to the multivariable analysis, greater word count (P = 0.001), being published in the Post-PRISMA period (P = 0.025) and geographic origin from Asia (P = 0.025) or South America (P = 0.015) were significantly associated with higher reporting quality. Conclusions/clinical significance: The reporting quality of SR abstracts in operative dentistry had improved significantly after the publication of PRISMA-A, but was still suboptimal.

However, the results of current studies are controversial and the effects of these neuraxial adjuvants remain unclear. AIM To evaluate the effects of neuraxial adjuvants on perioperative shivering during cesarean sections, thus providing an optimal choice for clinical application. METHODS A systematic review and network meta-analysis were conducted following the PRISMA (Preferred Reported Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis) guidelines. Analyses were performed using Review Manager 5.3 and Stata 14.0. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central databases for eligible clinical trials assessing the effects of neuraxial adjuvants on perioperative shivering and other adverse events during cesarean sections. Perioperative shivering was defined as the primary endpoint, and nausea, vomiting, pruritus, hypotension, and bradycardia were the secondary outcomes. RESULTS Twenty-six studies using 9 neuraxial adjuvants for obstetric anesthesia during caesarean sections were included. The results showed that, compared with placebo, pethidine, fentanyl, dexmedetomidine, and sufentanil significantly reduced the incidence of perioperative shivering. Among the four neuraxial adjuvants, pethidine was the most effective one for shivering prevention (OR = 0.15, 95%CI: 0.07–0.35, surface under the cumulative ranking curve 83.9), but with a high incidence of nausea (OR = 3.15, 95%CI: 1.04–9.57) and vomiting (OR = 3.71, 95%CI: 1.81–7.58). The efficacy of fentanyl for shivering prevention was slightly inferior to pethidine (OR = 0.20, 95%CI: 0.09–0.43), however, it significantly decreased the incidence of nausea (OR = 0.34, 95%CI: 0.15–0.79) and vomiting (OR = 0.25, 95%CI: 0.11–0.56). In addition, compared with sufentanil, fentanyl showed no impact on haemodynamic stability and the incidence of pruritus. CONCLUSION Pethidine, fentanyl, dexmedetomidine, and sufentanil appear to be effective for preventing perioperative shivering in puerperae undergoing cesarean sections. Considering the risk-benefit profiles of the included neuraxial adjuvants, fentanyl is probably the optimal choice. © 2019. Published by Baishideng Publishing Group Inc.

PRISMA-NMA includes 32 items: 27 core items as indicated in the 2009 PRISMA Statement and five items specific to the reporting of NMAs. Although NMA reporting is improving, it is unclear whether PRISMA-NMA has accelerated this improvement. We aimed to investigate the impact of PRISMA-NMA and highlight key items that require attention and improvement. Methods: We updated our previous collection of NMAs with articles published between April 2015 and July 2018. We assessed the completeness of reporting for each NMA, including main manuscript and online supplements, using the PRISMA-NMA checklist. The PRISMA-NMA checklist originally includes 32 total items (i.e. a 32-point scale original PRISMA-NMA score). We also prepared a modified version of the PRISMA-NMA checklist with 49 items to evaluate separately at a more granular level all multiple-content items (i.e. a 49-point scale modified PRISMA-NMA score). We compared average reporting scores of articles published until and after 2015. Results: In the 1144 included NMAs the mean modified PRISMA-NMA score was 32.1 (95% CI 31.8–32.4) of a possible 49-excellence-score. For 1-year increase, the mean modified score increased by 0.96 (95% CI 0.32 to 1.59) for 389 NMAs published until 2015 and by 0.53 (95% CI 0.02 to 1.04) for 755 NMAs published after 2015. The mean modified PRISMA-NMA score for NMAs published after 2015 was higher by 0.81 (95% CI 0.23 to 1.39) compared to before 2015 when adjusting for journal impact factor, type of review, funding, and treatment category.

Conclusions: NMAs published after 2015 more frequently reported the five items associated with NMA compared to those published until 2015. However, improvement in reporting after 2015 is compatible with that observed on a yearly basis until 2015, and hence, it could not be attributed solely to the publication of the PRISMA-NMA. © 2021, The Author(s).",,10.1186/s13643-021-01780-9,,34507621,NA,do reporting guidelines have an impact empirical assessment of changes in reporting before and after the prisma extension statement for network metaanalysis

Material and methods: Three hundred and forty-nine articles were retrieved in the PubMed and Cochrane databases using the search-terms “stylohyoid syndrome” and synonyms. Articles documenting treatment and outcome with more than 1 month's follow-up were selected. Treatment-related complications and rate of cure, defined as disappearance of symptoms and/or of revelatory complication, were analyzed. Overall analysis was performed for series and a mixed logistic regression model for case reports. Results: Hundred and two articles (12 series, 90 case reports) were selected. The 12 series included 482 patients with pain syndrome managed by styloidectomy, with 84.2% and 73.7% cure rates for cervical and transoral approaches, respectively. There were no complications with the transoral approach, versus 1.2% transient facial paresis with the cervical approach. In the 90 case reports, 112 patients had pain syndrome (Group I) and 16 neurological deficit (Group II). Cure rate in Group I varied significantly (P = 0.005; OR 8.33, 95% CI [2.12–32.81]) from 64.3% following medical treatment (antiepileptics, muscle relaxants, analgesics, per os and/or locally injected anti-inflammatory drugs) to 91.8% following styloidectomy, without any significant impact of surgical approach (P = 0.1; OR 0.17, 95% CI [0.02–1.60]). In Group I, no complications occurred after medical treatment, versus 4.3% and 16.3% after transoral and cervical styloidectomy, respectively. In Group II, cure and complication rates were 87.5% and 6.2%, respectively. Due to the small sample size and heterogeneity of Group II, no statistical assessment of the contribution of styloidectomy to medical treatment (antiplatelet drugs, with or without stenting) was performed. Conclusion: Styloidectomy appears to be the treatment of choice for stylohyoid syndrome. The surgical approach does not significantly influence the cure or complications rate. © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS",,10.1016/j.anorl.2019.05.002,,31126893,NA,management of stylohyoid syndrome a systematic review following prisma guidelines

Moxibustion is a representative external treatment in traditional Chinese medicine that has been beneficial to DPN. We aim to systematically assess the efficacy and safety of moxibustion in treating DPN, following PRISMA guidelines.Methods:Eight electronic databases were searched to acquire information on eligible trials published from inception to June 1, 2019. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) applying moxibustion therapy with a minimum of 14-days treatment duration for DPN patients compared with placebo, no intervention, or conventional WM interventions. The primary outcomes in our study include the sensory-nerve conduction velocity (SNCV) and motor-nerve conduction velocity (MNCV). We used the Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias tool to assess the methodological quality of eligible RCTs. Statistical analyses were conducted using Review Manager 5.3. Risk ratios (RR) and mean differences (MD) were calculated with a 95% confidence interval (CI). The χ2test was applied to assess the heterogeneity.Results:In total, 11 RCTs were included that involved 927 DPN patients. Compared with the control group, there was an increase in median MNCV (MD=6.26, 95% CI 2.64-9.89, Z=3.39, P=.0007) and peroneal MNCV (MD=6.45, 95% CI 5.30-7.61, P<.00001). There was also an increase in median SNCV (MD=6.64, 95% CI 3.25-10.03, P=.0001) and peroneal SNCV (MD=3. 57, 95% CI 2.06-5.09, Z=4.63, P<.00001) in the treatment groups. The treatment groups receiving moxibustion therapy indicated a more significant improvement in total effectiveness rate (RR=0.25, 95% CI 0.18-0.37, Z=7.16, P<.00001). Toronto Clinical Scoring System indicated a significant decrease in the treatment groups (MD=-2.12, 95% CI -2.82 to 1.43, P<.00001). Only 1 study reported that treatment groups experienced no adverse reactions. The other 10 studies did not mention adverse events.Conclusions:Moxibustion therapy may be an effective and safe option for DPN patients but needs to be verified in further rigorous studies. © 2020 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

However, the results are not consistent in reported original studies, as well as in published meta-analysis. This study aims to clarify the relationship between overweight/obesity and kidney cancer by an updated overall and dose-response meta-analysis. Methods: This meta-analysis was conducted in accordance with PRISMA guideline. Relevant studies were searched using PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases. The studies were limited to human cohort studies in English and Chinese language. Random-effect models and dose-response meta-analysis were used to synthesize the results. Subgroup analyses were also conducted based on the characteristics of participants. Results: Twenty-four cohort studies with 8,953,478 participants were included in our meta-analysis. Compared to the normal weight, the pooled RRs of kidney cancer was 1.35 (1.27–1.43) in overweight and 1.76 (1.61–1.91) in obese participants. An increased kidney cancer risk of 1.06 (1.05–1.06) for each 1 kg/m2 increase in BMI was showed in dose-response meta-analysis. No significant heterogeneity was found across studies with I2 = 39.4% for overweight, and I2 = 43.3% for obesity.

Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) combined with chemotherapy drugs interventions have been applied for the treatment of malignant tumors in Asian countries for dacades. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness and safety on the combination of Kanglaite injection and fluorouracil-based chemotherapy for treating digestive tract malignancies.Purpose:To assess the effectiveness and safety on the combination of Kanglaite injection and fluorouracil-based chemotherapy for digestive tract malignancies.Methods:The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed when conducting the meta-analysis. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of Kanglaite injection combined with fluorouracil-based chemotherapy in the treatment of digestive tract malignant tumors were selected and assessed for inclusion. RevMan 5.3 software (Cochrane Collaboration, Oxford, UK) was used for meta-analysis. The objective response rate (ORR) was defined as the primary endpoint, and the disease control rate (DCR), quality of life (QoL), and toxicities were the secondary outcomes.Results:20 RCTs enrolling 1339 patients with advanced digestive tract malignancies were included. The methodological quality of most included trials was low to moderate. Compared with fluorouracil-based chemotherapy alone, Kanglaite injection plus fluorouracil-based chemotherapy can improve DCR (risk ratio (RR) = 1.18, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.11-1.25, P < .00001), ORR (RR = 1.35, 95% CI 1.18-1.54, P < .00001), QoL (RR = 1.58, 95% CI 1.35-1.85, P < .00001), and can reduce adverse drug reactions (ADRs) such as myelosuppression (RR = 0.33, 95% CI 0.25-0.43, P < .00001), leukopenia (RR = 0.31, 95% CI 0.22-0.43, P < .00001), thrombocytopenia (RR = 0.6, 95% CI 0.38-0.49, P = .03), neutropenia (RR = 0.26, 95% CI 0.12-0.55, P = .0005), anemia (RR = 0.41, 95% CI 0.23-0.75, P = .004), gastrointestinal reaction (RR = 0.35, 95% CI 0.27-0.46, P < .00001), nausea/vomiting (RR = 0.41, 95% CI 0.28-0.61, P < .00001), diarrhea (RR = 0.34, 95% CI 0.18-0.62, P = .0004), hepatotoxicity (RR = 0.28, 95% CI 0.17-0.47, P < .00001), neurotoxicity (RR = 0.58, 95% CI 0.41-0.82, P = .002), mucositis (RR = 0.59, 95% CI 0.29-1.21, P = .15).Conclusion:Kanglaite injection combined with fluorouracil-based chemotherapy could remarkably improve the clinical effectiveness and reduce the adverse effects in patients with advanced malignant tumors of the digestive tract which may provide evidence to judge whether TCM is an effective and safe intervention for the digestive tract malignancies.

Material and methods. The studied group included 40 patients with prismatic correction and was divided into 2 groups of patients depending on the type of strabismus: 25 patients with incomitant strabismus, 15 patients with comitant strabismus. Elastic Fresnel prisms (EFP) were chosen and prescribed for prismatic correction. The patients were under dynamic monitoring under conditions of continuous use of EFP and positional trainings were performed if necessary (when doubling wasn’t completely compensated by EFP). The study had a prospective character. Results and its discussion. The prismatic correction made it possible to eliminate diplopia in direct gaze position and peripheral gaze directions in all 25 patients with paretic strabismus. In 18 out of 20 cases, the prismatic correction allowed to achieve functional recovery without subsequent chemorecession or surgical treatment. In 8 patients with comitant strabismus after the first stage of surgical treatment with stable deviation, binocular vision was formed under natural conditions. In 1 year, dynamic prismatic correction contributed to the recovery of 7 patients without surgical treatment with orthophoria in vivo. Conclusion. Prismatic correction of diplopia as an independent or additional functional method of treatment contributes to the achievement of the comitance of the eye muscles. © 2019, Institute of Cytology and Genetics of Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences.

Systematic reviews (SRs) on moxibustion are increasing. Although the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement provides guidelines for SRs, the quality of moxibustion-related SRs is still not satisfactory. In particular, descriptions of the interventions and the rationale for using moxibustion are insufficient. To address these inadequacies, the working group developed this PRISMA extension for reporting SRs of moxibustion (PRISMA-M 2020). Methods: A group of CM clinical professionals, methodologists of SRs, reporting guideline developers, and journal editors developed this PRISMA-M 2020 through a comprehensive process that includes registration, literature review, consensus meetings, Delphi exercises for soliciting comments, and revision, resulting in this final draft. Results: Seven of the 27 PRISMA checklist items, namely title (1), rationale (3), eligibility criteria (6), data item (11), additional analyses (16), study characteristics (18), and additional analysis (23), were extended, with specific reference to the application of moxibustion. Illustrative examples and explanations for each item are provided. Conclusion: The PRISMA-M 2020 will help improve the reporting quality of SRs with moxibustion.

The objectives of this study are (1) to assess how published LSRs report on the flow of studies through the different phases of the review for the different updates; (2) to propose an approach to reporting on that flow. Methods: For objective 1, we identified all LSRs published up to April 2021. We abstracted information regarding their general characteristics and how they reported on search results. For objective 2, we based our proposal for tailored PRISMA approaches on the findings from objective 1, as well as on our experience with conducting Cochrane LSRs. Results: We identified 279 living publications relating to 76 LSRs. Of the 279 publications, 11% were protocols, 23% were base versions (i.e., the first version), 50% were partial updates (i.e., does not include all typical sections of an SR), and 16% were full updates (i.e., includes all typical sections of an SR). We identified six ways to reporting the study flow: base separately, each update separately (38%); numbers not reported (32%); latest update separately, all previous versions combined (20%); base separately, all updates combined (7%); latest update version only (3%); all versions combined (0%). We propose recording in detail the results of the searches to keep track of all identified records. For structuring the flow diagram, we propose using one of four approaches. Conclusion: We identified six ways for reporting the study flow through the different phases of the review for the different update versions. We propose to document in detail the study flow for the different search updates and select one of our four tailored PRISMA diagram approaches to present that study flow. © 2022 Kahale LA et al.",,10.12688/f1000research.51723.3,,35136567,NA,tailored prisma 2020 flow diagrams for living systematic reviews a methodological survey and a proposal

Methodology: Fifty randomized clinical trials relating to Endodontics were randomly selected from the PubMed database from 2015 to 2019 and evaluated by two independent reviewers. For each trial, a score of ‘1’ was awarded when it fully reported each item in the PRIRATE guidelines whereas a score of ‘0’ was awarded when an item was not reported; when the item was reported inadequately a score of ‘0.5’ was awarded. For the items that were not relevant to the trial, ‘Not Applicable (NA)’ was given. Based on the interquartile range of the overall scores received, trials were categorized into ‘Low’ (0–58.4%), ‘Moderate’ (58.5–72.8%) and ‘High’ (72.9–100%) quality. The associations between characteristics and quality of clinical trials were investigated. Descriptive statistics, frequency analysis and percentage analyses were used to describe the data. To determine the significance of categorical data, the chi-square test was used. The probability value 0.05 was considered as the level of significance. Results: Based on the overall scores, 13 (26%), 25(50%) and 12 (24%) of the reports of clinical trials were categorized as ‘High’, ‘Moderate’ and ‘Low’ quality, respectively. Three items (1b, 6d, 11e) were adequately reported in all manuscripts whilst two items (5k, 5m) were scored ‘NA’ in all the reports. The reports published from Europe had a significantly greater percentage of ‘High’-quality scores, compared to Asia, Middle East, North America and South America (P = 0.0002). The ‘High’-quality reports were published significantly more often in impact factor journals (P = 0.045). Reports of clinical trials published in journals that adhered to the CONSORT guidelines had significantly more ‘High’ scores compared to those that did not (P = 0.008). Clinical trials with protocols registered a priori had a significantly greater percentage of ‘High’ scores compared to the trials that were not registered in advance (P = 0.003). No significant difference occurred between the quality of clinical trials and the number of authors, journal (Endodontic specialty vs. Non-Endodontic specialty) or year of publication. Conclusions: Reports of randomized clinical trials published in the speciality of Endodontics had a substantial number of deficiencies. To create high-quality reports of clinical trials, authors should comply with the PRIRATE 2020 guidelines. © 2021 International Endodontic Journal.

However, it is recognized that despite the existence of various guidelines, for example, the Consolidated Standards for Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement, the quality of manuscripts describing randomized trials is often suboptimal. The current project aims to develop and disseminate new guidelines, Preferred Reporting Items for RAndomized Trials in Endodontics (PRIRATE), to improve the planning and reporting quality of randomized trials in the field of Endodontics. The project leads (VN, PD) designed a robust process to develop the PRIRATE guidelines. At first, a steering committee of eight members, including the project leads, was formed. Thereafter, a five-stage consensus process will be followed: initial steps, pre-meeting activities, face-to-face consensus meeting, post-meeting activities and post-publication activities. The steering committee will develop the first draft of the PRIRATE guidelines by identifying relevant and important items from various sources including the CONSORT guidelines and the Clinical and Laboratory Images in Publications (CLIP) principles. This will be followed by the establishment of a PRIRATE Delphi Group (PDG) consisting of 30 members. The individual items of the first draft of the PRIRATE guidelines developed by the steering committee will be evaluated and scored on a 9-point Likert scale by the PDG members. Items with a score of seven and above by more than 70% of PDG members will be included in the second draft of the guidelines, and the Delphi process will be repeated until each item fulfils the set conditions. After obtaining consensus from the PDG, the PRIRATE guidelines will be discussed by 20 selected individuals within a PRIRATE Face-to-face Consensus Meeting Group (PFCMG) to arrive at a final consensus. The final PRIRATE guidelines will be accompanied with an explanation and elaboration document developed by the steering committee and approved by six members, three from the PDG and three from the PFCMG. The PRIRATE guidelines will be published in journals and actively disseminated to educational institutions, national and international academic societies and presented at scientific meetings. The steering committee will periodically revise and update the PRIRATE guidelines based on feedback from stakeholders. © 2019 International Endodontic Journal.

Based on the PRISMA method, we survey and describe commonly used ML techniques employed for KT shown in 51 articles on the topic, among 628 publications from 5 renowned academic sources. We identify and review relevant aspects of ML for KT in LM that contribute to a more accurate panorama of the topic and hence, help to choose an appropriate ML technique for KT in LM.

Whole-core, three-dimensional temperature profiles are computed at an individual fuel pin and lattice assembly block levels. A method that computes the fluid mass, velocity (momentum), and energy throughout a transient is implemented using a well-documented, semi-implicit pressure-correction scheme. Models for reactor cavity cooling system (RCCS) heat transfer and decay heat generation are also included. Pressurized (P-LOFC) and de-pressurized (D-LOFC) accidents are simulated. This method provides two significant advantages over available thermalhydraulic analysis techniques. The first is its ability to compute whole-core results and capture the important transient core-level phenomena such as bypass flow and heat redistribution into the reflector assemblies after reactor SCRAM. The second is its ability to compute each fuel assembly in detail, computing the heat rates and temperature profiles for every fuel pin, graphite, and coolant channel. These features produce realistic, 3-D transient results for prismatic HTGRs during a LOFC. A RELAP model is also developed and implemented for the HTGR. The limitations of existing methods for the simulation of the prismatic fuel are identified and the need for and novelty of the present method are highlighted. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",,10.1016/j.nucengdes.2020.110788,,NA,NA,wholecore transient analysis methodology for prismatic high temperature gas reactors

Methods: Abstracts of systematic reviews and meta-analyses in orthodontics published in PubMed, Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews databases before March 23, 2018, that met the predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria, were evaluated using the 12 items of PRISMA-A, scoring each item from 0 to 2. Abstracts were classified into 2 groups: before and after publication of the PRISMA-A checklist. Three calibrated evaluators (intraclass correlation coefficient and kappa > 0.8) assessed the scores for compliance with the checklist. The number of authors, country of affiliation of the first author, performance of meta-analysis, and topic of the article were recorded. A regression analysis was performed to assess the associations between abstract characteristics and the PRISMA-A scores. Results: Of 1034 abstracts evaluated, 389 were included in the analysis. The mean PRISMA-A score was 53.39 (95% CI, 51.83-54.96). The overall score for studies published after the publication of the checklist was significantly higher than for studies published before (P ≤ 0.0001). The components returning significantly higher scores after publication of PRISMA-A were title (P = 0.024), information from databases (P = 0.026), risk of bias (P ≤ 0.0001), included studies (P ≤ 0.0001), synthesis of results (P ≤ 0.0001), interpretation of results (P = 0.035), financing and conflict of interest (P ≤ 0.0001), and registration (P ≤ 0.0001). These results showed the positive effect of PRISMA-A had on the quality of reporting of orthodontics systematic reviews.

Study Design and Setting: We searched PubMed to identify all systematic reviews published in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Review or the core clinical journals in 2015, one year before the PRISMA harms checklist was published. We randomly selected, in a 1:1 ratio, Cochrane and non-Cochrane systematic reviews assessing drug effects (including both efficacy and safety). We used the PRISMA harms checklist published in 2016 to assess the quality of reporting of drug safety information. Multivariable linear regression analyses were used to explore the association of six prespecified variables with more complete reporting of PRISMA harms items. Results: We included 120 systematic reviews, including 60 Cochrane and 60 non-Cochrane reviews. Scores on the PRISMA harms checklist (23 items) were low (median 4, [first, third quartile: 2, 6]), with no difference between Cochrane and non-Cochrane reviews (4.5 [2, 7] vs. 4 [2.5, 5]; P = 0.29). Among all eligible reviews, only one item (i.e., state conclusions in coherence with the review findings) was reported adequately (proportion of adherence 81.6%); proportion of reporting for other items ranged from 1.7% to 68.3%. The four essential reporting items from PRISMA harms checklist were also poorly complied (proportion of adherence ranged from 1.7% to 9.2%). Multivariable linear regression analyses found no significant associations between any study characteristic and reporting on the PRISMA harms, likely because of limited variability in scores across studies.

Despite their increasing popularity, there are currently no systematically developed reporting guidelines for overviews. This is problematic because the reporting of published overviews varies considerably and is often substandard. Our objective is to use explicit, systematic, and transparent methods to develop an evidence-based and agreement-based reporting guideline for overviews of reviews of healthcare interventions (PRIOR, Preferred Reporting Items for Overviews of Reviews). Methods: We will develop the PRIOR reporting guideline in four stages, using established methods for developing reporting guidelines in health research. First, we will establish an international and multidisciplinary expert advisory board that will oversee the conduct of the project and provide methodological support. Second, we will use the results of comprehensive literature reviews to develop a list of prospective checklist items for the reporting guideline. Third, we will use a modified Delphi exercise to achieve a high level of expert agreement on the list of items to be included in the PRIOR reporting guideline. We will identify and recruit a group of up to 100 international experts who will provide input into the guideline in three Delphi rounds: The first two rounds will occur via online survey, and the third round will occur during a smaller (8 to 10 participants) in-person meeting that will use a nominal group technique. Fourth, we will produce and publish the PRIOR reporting guideline.

The quality of reporting in these studies is guided by the 2015 Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Individual Participant Data (PRISMA-IPD) guidelines. The growing number of IPD-MA published for stroke studies calls for an assessment of the compliance of these studies with the PRISMA-IPD statement. Methods: PubMed and EMBASE were searched for MA in stroke published between January 1, 2016, and March 30, 2020, in journals with impact factor >2. Literature reviews, scoping reviews, and aggregate MA were excluded. The final articles were scored using the 31-item PRISMA-IPD checklist. Results were depicted using descriptive statistics. Compliance with each item in PRISM-IPD guideline was recorded. The study was defined as compliant to IPD analyses if it satisfied all IPD specific items. Results: From an initial set of 321 articles, 31 met the final eligibility for data extraction. Only 4 (13%) described the use of PRISMA-IPD guidelines in their methodology, while 8/31 (26%) used the old PRISMA guidelines and 19/31 (61%) followed none. Regardless of mention of using IPD specific guidelines, 42% (n=13) of studies were compliant with all 4 IPD specific domains. The poorest areas of compliance were bias assessment within (32%) and across (39%) studies, reporting protocol and registration (42%), and reporting of IPD integrity (48%). The median journal impact factor was similar between the compliant (median, 8.1 [interquartile range, 5.4-39.9]) and noncompliant (median, 6 [interquartile range, 4.5-16.2]) groups (P=0.24). Similarly, the journal, country of correspondence, number of authors, number of studies included in MA, study sample size, and funding source were statistically similar between the groups. Conclusions: For the published IPD-MA stroke studies, the compliance with PRISMA-IPD statement and compliance with 4 IPD specific items was suboptimal. The journal, author, and study-related factors were not associated with compliance. Additional scrutiny measures to ensure adherence to mandated guidelines might increase the compliance. Several avenues to improve compliance and ensure optimal adherence are discussed. © 2021 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Methods: We searched the Physiotherapy Evidence Database on January 2018 for all low back pain systematic reviews, published between 2015 and 2017. Our primary outcomes were PRISMA recommendations endorsement by the journal and 2017 journal impact factor. We assessed systematic review methodological quality using the AMSTAR-2 (A MeaSurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews) and reported descriptive statistics. A multivariate linear regression model was built. We assessed 66 systematic reviews published in 42 journals. Thirty-seven journals had an impact factor (mean 4.0, SD 4.8). 55% journals endorsed the PRISMA recommendations. The methodological quality of 75.8% systematic reviews was critically low. Journals with higher impact factor were associated with journals endorsing the PRISMA recommendations (ß 3.7; 95% CI 1.2, 6.3), but were not associated with the reviews’ methodological quality (ß − 0.3; 95% CI − 4.8, 4.3). Limitations: Our findings may not be generalized to other study populations and interventions such as medical devices, surgery and medication. Conclusions: Three out of every four published low back pain systematic reviews had critically low methodological quality. Journals with higher impact factor were associated with journals endorsing the PRISMA recommendations. Clinicians must know how to critically appraise reviews. Journals’ editorial policies should include the assessment of study methodological quality and reporting in the review process of an article.

The researchers contributed a lot to spreading knowledge about IPv6 vulnerabilities and how to address them over the past two decades. In this study, a systematic literature review is conducted to analyze research progress in IPv6 security field following the Preferred Reporting Items for the Systematics Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) method. A total of 427 studies have been reviewed from two databases, IEEE and Scopus. To fulfil the review goal, several key data elements were extracted from each study and two kinds of analysis were administered: descriptive analysis and literature classification. The results show positive signs of the research contributions in the field, and generally, they could be considered as a reference to explore the research of in the past two decades in IPv6 security field and to draw the future directions. For example, the percentage of publishing increased from 147 per decade from 2000-2010 to 330 per decade from 2011 to 2020 which means that the percentage increase was 124%. The number of citations is another key finding that reflects the great global interest in research devoted to IPv6 security issues, as it was 409 citations in the decade from 2000-2010, then increased to 1643 citations during the decade from 2011 to 2020, that is, the percentage increase was 302%. © 2022 Authors.

Methods: Electronic search performed in August 2018 to retrieve meta-analyses published from April 2014 to May 2018. PRISMA evaluation was determined by total scores of individual meta-analyses and items scores. Statistical analysis of parameters affecting the reporting evaluation included subgroup multivariate analysis and regression analysis. Results: Twelve meta-analyses were finally included, three being Cochrane systematic reviews. Mean PRISMA score is 23.2/27 (86.1%). Eleven PRISMA ITEMS had significantly higher %score in 12 meta-analyses than in nine non-Cochrane meta-analyses measurements. Positive strong correlation identified between PRISMA %score and journal impact factor (JIF). Multivariate analysis between high-scored and low-scored meta-analyses established difference in means of several parameters (JIF, Publication Year). Conclusions: The evaluation of overall reporting quality was favorable. As expected, the key role of several characteristics of meta-analysis affects this quality. Under-reporting of specific items (protocol, search strategy and assessment of risk of bias) indicates the urgency for PRISMA compliance. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.",,10.1007/s10792-019-01282-7,,31912405,NA,assessment of reporting quality of metaanalyses of randomized controlled trials in neovascular agerelated macular degeneration published from april 2014 to may 2018 using prisma statement

Protein hydrolysis cleaves storage proteins at either C-terminal or N-terminal of peptide bonds producing unique peptide sequences with various nutritional and functional properties as well as amino acids with aromatic, hydrophobic and charged ends. Scope and approach: The Web of Science database was searched for studies published between 2014 and 2019 using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines in order to investigate the relationship between RBPHs and functional/health outcomes. The aim of this review is to reinforce and summarise the protective role of RBPHs as an antioxidant, an antidiabetic agent and an Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor with other nutritional properties and functional properties. Key findings and conclusions: RBP cleaved by different enzymes produces low molecular weight (MW) antioxidant peptides with radical scavenging activity and metal chelation power. These peptides restrain ACE activity and significantly reduce the intracellular ACE levels in rodent models. These peptides are also antidiabetic as they inhibit amylase, α- and β-glucosidase and dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV). They also suppress intracellular glutathione (GSH) levels by down-regulating the expression of a variety of inflammatory factors including 2(Nrf2), quinone oxidoreductase1 (NQO1) and hemeoxygenase 1 (HO-1). The health promoting effects of anti-melanogenesis, antimicrobial, and iron availability enhancement are described. Plus, RBPHs fortified food shows better preservation against lipid oxidation. Nowadays, turning rice mill wastes into the more manageable and sustainable applications has received attentions for their nutritional and functional properties rather than only animal feeds and a source of the biomass fuel. But the application of the rice bran for nutritional purposes is still limited. The high cost of the enzymes and the sensitive nature of peptides are the major industrial concerns. It is expected that the number of rice bran products and their acceptance will increase in the future market. © 2021",,10.1016/j.tifs.2021.01.089,,NA,NA,investigation of nutritional and functional effects of rice bran protein hydrolysates by using preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and metaanalysis prisma guidelines a review

To evaluate the effectiveness of transcranial direct current stimulation (tdCS) on pain and function in patients with knee osteoarthritis (oA). Methods. The meta-analysis data source were PubMed (MEdLiNE) and Cochrane (Central). Randomized controlled trials comparing active tdCS (in combination with other interventions or alone in knee oA patients) with sham tdCS published in English till July 2019 were analysed. The outcome measures were pain intensity (visual analogue scale and numeric rating scale) and function (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities osteoarthritis index [WoMAC]). Mean difference with 95% confidence interval for the active tdCS and sham groups were investigated. Results. Four articles with 171 patients were included in the qualitative systematic review and 2 articles with 55 patients were included in the quantitative meta-analysis. The results revealed a statistically significant reduction in pain (visual analogue scale) in the active tdCS group compared with the sham group (Z = 7.32, p < 0.00001) and a significant improvement in WoMAC scores (Z = 2.31, p = 0.02), with high heterogeneity of 83%. Conclusions. There is a significant improvement in pain and function in patients with knee oA after the application of active tdCS either alone or in combination. However, more studies are required to confirm the effectiveness of tdCS in knee oA. owing to the promising results of tdCS in various pain conditions and in knee oA, it can be seen as a future tool for managing pain in the field of physiotherapy. © University School of Physical Education in Wrocław",,10.5114/pq.2020.100282,,NA,NA,effectiveness of transcranial direct current stimulation on pain and function in knee osteoarthritis a systematic review with metaanalysis based on prisma guidelines

Its active ingredients are β-, γ- and δ-elemene, which are extracted from Curcuma aromatica Salisb. (Curcuma wenyujin Y.H. Chen & C. Ling). Purpose: To evaluate the effects of Elemene injection as adjunctive treatment to platinum-based chemotherapy (PBC) in patients with stage III/IV non-small cell lung cancer. Study design: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials (RCTs). Materials and methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted following the PRISMA (Preferred Reported Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis) guidelines. Analyses were performed using Review Manager 5.3, Comprehensive Meta-Analysis 3.0 and Trial Sequential Analysis software. All RCTs comparing Elemene injection combined with PBC vs. PBC alone were selected and assessed for inclusion. The disease control rate (DCR) was defined as the primary endpoint, and the objective Response rate (ORR), survival rate, quality of life (QOL), cellular immune function and toxicities were the secondary outcomes. Results: 15 RCTs recruiting 1,410 patients with stage III/IV NSCLC were included. The methodological quality of most included trials was low to moderate. Compared with PBC alone, Elemene injection plus PBC can improve DCR (RR = 1.23, 95% CI 1.16 to 1.31, p < 0.00001), ORR (RR = 1.62, 95% CI 1.44 to 1.82, p < 0.00001), 1- and 2-year survival rates (RR = 1.33, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.59, p = 0.002; RR = 1.73, 95% CI 1.21 to 2.46, p = 0.002, respectively), QOL (RR = 1.91, 95% CI 1.58 to 2.32, p < 0.00001), CD                             4                                                          +                             T cell counts (WMD = 10.43, 95% CI 8.25 to 12.62, p < 0.00001), and the CD                             4                                                          +                             /CD                             8                                                          +                             ratio (WMD = 0.78, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.14, p < 0.0001) and can reduce severe toxicities by 58% (RR = 0.42, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.52, p < 0.00001). Conclusion: Elemene injection is a safe and effective adjunctive treatment to platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with stage III/IV NSCLC. Elemene injection can improve clinical efficacy, enhance cellular immune function and alleviate the toxicity of chemotherapy.

Methods: We reviewed 60 documents with reporting guidance for systematic reviews to generate suggested modifications to the PRISMA 2009 statement. We invited 220 systematic review methodologists and journal editors to complete a survey about the suggested modifications. The results of these projects were discussed at a 21-member in-person meeting. Following the meeting, we drafted the PRISMA 2020 statement and refined it based on feedback from co-authors and a convenience sample of 15 systematic reviewers. Results: The review of 60 documents revealed that all topics addressed by the PRISMA 2009 statement could be modified. Of the 110 survey respondents, more than 66% recommended keeping six of the original checklist items as they were and modifying 15 of them using wording suggested by us. Attendees at the in-person meeting supported the revised wording for several items but suggested rewording for most to enhance clarity, and further refinements were made over six drafts of the guideline. Conclusions: The PRISMA 2020 statement consists of updated reporting guidance for systematic reviews.

Important sources of evidence are systematic reviews (SRs) and meta-analyses (MAs), but these can only be informative provided their quality is sufficiently high, which can only be assessed if reporting is adequate. The purpose of this study was to assess the quality of reporting of SRs and MAs in emergency medicine using the PRISMA statement. Methods: The top five emergency medicine related journals were selected using the 5-year impact factor of the ISI Web of Knowledge of 2015. All SRs and MAs published in these journals between 2015 and 2016 were extracted and assessed independently by two reviewers on compliance with each item of the PRISMA statement. Results: The included reviews (n = 112) reported a mean of 18 ± 4 items of the PRISMA statement adequately. Reviews mentioning PRISMA adherence did not show better reporting than review without mention of adherence (mean 18.6 (SE 0.4) vs. mean 17.8 (SE 0.5); p = 0.214). Reviews published in journals recommending or requiring adherence to a reporting guideline showed better quality of reporting than journals without such instructions (mean 19.2 (SE 0.4) vs. mean 17.2 (SE 0.5); p = 0.001). Conclusion: There is room for improvement of the quality of reporting of SRs and MAs within the emergency medicine literature. Therefore, authors should use a reporting guideline such as the PRISMA statement.

A systematic review was performed, following the PRISMA guidelines, of the empirical studies found in PubMed and ScienceDirect, a total of 18 studies being included altogether. Results and conclusions. The results consistently point to the implication of two opposing neural systems in this bias: one appetitive, involving the striatum and the frontal regions, and one aversive, involving the amygdala and the insula, which interact with each other when it comes to making a decision about different monetary bets and display a higher sensitivity towards losses. Although their functioning is not yet clear, what does seem evident is that the consistent involvement of these structures lends support to prospect theory and the limited rationality approach. © 2019 Revista de Neurología.",,10.33588/rn.6802.2018276,,30638254,NA,the neural bases of loss aversion in economic contexts a systematic review according to the prisma guidelines bases neurales de la aversión a las pérdidas en contextos económicos revisión sistemática según las directrices prisma

The aim of this study was to assess the reporting quality of systematic reviews of interventions aimed at improving vaccination coverage using the recommended Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guideline. PubMed and Cochrane Library were searched to identify SRs of interventions to improve immunization coverage, indexed up to May 2016. Two authors independently screened the search output, assessed study eligibility, and extracted data from eligible SRs using a 27-item data collection form derived from PRISMA. Discrepancies in reviews assessments were resolved by discussion and consensus. A total of 57 reviews were included in this study with a mean percentage of applicable PRISMA items that were met across all studies of 66% (range 19–100%) and median compliance of 70%. 39 out of the 57 reviews were published after the release of the PRISMA statement in 2009. Highest compliance was observed in items related to the “description of rational”, “description of eligibility criteria”, “synthesis of results” and “provision of a general interpretation of the results” (items #3, #6, #14 and #26, respectively). Compliance was poorest in the items “describing summary of evidence” (item 24, 19%), “describing indication of review protocol and registration” (item 5, 26%) and “describing results of risk of bias across studies (item 22, 33%).

In this study, we have performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of published trials to confirm the clinical efficacy and safety of sTPs, and determine the optimal types, usages, and sTP/chemotherapy combinations to produce the desired responses. Materials and methods: We collected all studies regarding combined sTP therapy and chemotherapy for NSCLC from the Chinese and English databases (up to October 2018). Bias risk was evaluated for each. Data for meta-analysis was extracted using a pre-designed form. Evidence quality was rated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. Results: We included 27 randomized controlled trials containing 1925 patients, most with unclear bias risk. Combining sTPs with chemotherapy significantly increased the objective response rate [1.28, (1.13 to 1.45)], disease control rate [1.10, (1.01 to 1.18)], quality of life (QOL) [2.05, (1.62, 2.60)], and 1-year overall survival rate [1.43, (1.15 to 1.78)], with decreased risks of neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and gastrointestinal reactions. Optimal conditions included treatment in combination with gemcitabine or navelbine and cisplatin, twice a week, with one 3-week cycle. In these conditions, thymosin α1 improved both antitumor immunity and tumor response. Most results had good robustness, and their quality ranged from moderate to very low. Conclusions: The results suggest that treatment with sTPs, especially thymosin α1, and concomitant chemotherapy is beneficial to the patient, and provide evidence for optimal treatment regimens that may increase patient QOL and survival. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",,10.1016/j.intimp.2019.105747,,31326719,NA,clinical efficacy and safety of synthetic thymic peptides with chemotherapy for nonsmall cell lung cancer in china a systematic review and metaanalysis of 27 randomized controlled trials following the prisma guidelines

Despite the prevalent use of the PRISMA statement in medicine and nursing, no studies have examined authors' perception of it. The purpose of this study is to explore the perception of the PRISMA statement of authors who published reviews, meta-analyses, or both in nursing journals. Design Cross-sectional descriptive study. Methods An online survey was conducted among authors who published reviews, meta-analyses, or both in nursing journals between 2011 and 2017. The selected authors' email addresses were extracted from the PUBMED database. A questionnaire - with a 10-point Likert scale (1 - not important at all to 10 - very important) - was developed to elicit their responses regarding their perception of not only the PRISMA statement as a whole, but also the individual items therein. Results Invitations were sent to 1960 valid email addresses identified, with 230 responses (response rate: 11.7%) and 181 completed responses (completion rate: 9.2%). The average perceived importance of the PRISMA statement was 8.66 (SD=1.35), while the perceived importance for the individual items ranged from 7.74 to 9.32. Six items were rated significantly higher than the average rating, whereas one item was rated significantly lower. Conclusion Most respondents perceived the PRISMA statement as important.

Whether the risk of CACL tear is related to graft selection remains controversial due to contradictory results in studies. There are no meta-analyses to compare which graft has a higher CACL injury rate. Hence, this meta-analysis was conducted to compare the incidence of the CACL injury after ACL reconstruction with bone-patellar tendon-bone (BPTB) autografts compared with hamstring (HT) autografts.Methods:A comprehensive search of literature published between 1980 and January 2020 was performed using MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library databases. RevMan 5.3 software was used for meta-analysis. The overall risk ratio (RR) was calculated using a fixed- or random-effects. The heterogeneity among the included results was analyzed by chi-square test with significance set at P < .10, and the heterogeneity was quantitatively detected by I-square tests.Results:Fifteen prospective comparative studies met inclusion criteria. In the BPTB group, the CACL rupture rate ranged from 1.8% to 30%, with a pooled percentage of 8.5%. In the HT group, the CACL rupture rate ranged from 0% to 14.4%, with a pooled percentage of 3.3%. The overall CACL rupture rate was 3.1% and ranged from 1.1% to 27.1%, with a pooled percentage of 4.9%. The pooled results indicate that there was a statistical significant difference in CACL rupture risk rate between BPTB and HT autograft. (RR, 1.53; 95% CL, 1.21-1.91; P = .0004).Conclusion:This review showed that patients undergoing primary ACL reconstruction with BPTB autograft were more likely to have CACL rupture than patients treated with HT autograft. © 2020 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Meta-analyses can resolve long-standing disputes, dispel spurious claims, and generate new research questions. At their worst, however, meta-analysis publications are wolves in sheep's clothing: subjective with biased conclusions, hidden under coats of objective authority. Conclusions can be rendered unreliable by inappropriate statistical methods, problems with the methods used to select primary research, or problems within the primary research itself. Because of these risks, meta-analyses are increasingly conducted as part of systematic reviews, which use structured, transparent, and reproducible methods to collate and summarise evidence. For readers to determine whether the conclusions from a systematic review or meta-analysis should be trusted – and to be able to build upon the review – authors need to report what they did, why they did it, and what they found. Complete, transparent, and reproducible reporting is measured by ‘reporting quality’. To assess perceptions and standards of reporting quality of systematic reviews and meta-analyses published in ecology and evolutionary biology, we surveyed 208 researchers with relevant experience (as authors, reviewers, or editors), and conducted detailed evaluations of 102 systematic review and meta-analysis papers published between 2010 and 2019. Reporting quality was far below optimal and approximately normally distributed. Measured reporting quality was lower than what the community perceived, particularly for the systematic review methods required to measure trustworthiness. The minority of assessed papers that referenced a guideline (~16%) showed substantially higher reporting quality than average, and surveyed researchers showed interest in using a reporting guideline to improve reporting quality. The leading guideline for improving reporting quality of systematic reviews is the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. Here we unveil an extension of PRISMA to serve the meta-analysis community in ecology and evolutionary biology: PRISMA-EcoEvo (version 1.0). PRISMA-EcoEvo is a checklist of 27 main items that, when applicable, should be reported in systematic review and meta-analysis publications summarising primary research in ecology and evolutionary biology. In this explanation and elaboration document, we provide guidance for authors, reviewers, and editors, with explanations for each item on the checklist, including supplementary examples from published papers. Authors can consult this PRISMA-EcoEvo guideline both in the planning and writing stages of a systematic review and meta-analysis, to increase reporting quality of submitted manuscripts. Reviewers and editors can use the checklist to assess reporting quality in the manuscripts they review. Overall, PRISMA-EcoEvo is a resource for the ecology and evolutionary biology community to facilitate transparent and comprehensively reported systematic reviews and meta-analyses. © 2021 The Authors.

DEGs were screened by t test after logarithmization of raw data; then, the common DEGs between the 2 gene expression profiles were identified by up-regulation and down-regulation intersection. The DEGs were analyzed using bioinformatics, and a protein-protein interaction (PPI) survival network was constructed using STRING. Survival curves were constructed to explore the relationship between core genes and the prognosis of sepsis patients based on GSE54514 data.Results:A total of 688 common DEGs were identified between survivors and non-survivors of sepsis, and 96 genes were involved in survival networks. The crucial genes Signal transducer and activator of transcription 5A (STAT5A), CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein beta (CEBPB), Myc proto-oncogene protein (MYC), and REL-associated protein (RELA) were identified and showed increased expression in sepsis survivors.

Recently, the relationship between platelet parameters and DR has become a hot topic. Whether platelet parameters have clinical value in DR is controversial. Methods: Literature was retrieved by formal search of electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane library, Scopus, and CNKI) and by hand searching of reference lists of related articles from the beginning of building database to December 2017. Review manager 5.3 was utilized to deal with statistical data. This study was registered at International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (number: CRD42018093773). Results: This study included 1720 DR patients, 1477 type 2 diabetic mellitus (T2DM) without DR patients and 1456 health controls in 21 eligible studies. We found there was significant increase of platelet distribution width (PDW) level in the comparison of DR versus Control group (standard mean difference [SMD] [95% confidence interval [CI]]=1.04 [0.68, 1.40]) and DR versus T2DM without DR group (SMD [95% CI]=0.68 [0.40, 0.95]). For platelet count (PLT), it showed obvious decrease in the comparison of DR versus T2DM without DR group (SMD [95% CI]=-0.26 [-0.49, -0.03]) and no difference in comparison of DR versus Control (SMD [95% CI]=- 0.26 [-0.51, -0.00]). Subgroup analysis showed that significant result of PDW level appeared in China and Turkey in all comparisons, while similar results of PLT only in China. In addition, PDW level was different in various DR-subtypes, obvious high level in proliferation DR. Conclusions: We concluded that the guiding significance of PDW and PLT in diagnosis and monitor of DR, and especially, application of PDW to PDR management may have potential sense.

METHODS: MEDLINE® was searched for DTA systematic reviews published October 2017 to January 2018. The search time span was modulated to reach the desired sample size of 100 systematic reviews. Reporting on a per-item basis using PRISMA-DTA was evaluated. RESULTS: One hundred reviews were included. Mean reported items were 18.6 of 26 (71%; SD = 1.9) for PRISMA-DTA and 5.5 of 11 (50%; SD = 1.2) for PRISMA-DTA for abstracts. Items in the results were frequently reported. Items related to protocol registration, characteristics of included studies, results synthesis, and definitions used in data extraction were infrequently reported. Infrequently reported items from PRISMA-DTA for abstracts included funding information, strengths and limitations, characteristics of included studies, and assessment of applicability. Reporting completeness was higher in higher impact factor journals (18.9 vs 18.1 items; P = 0.04), studies that cited PRISMA (18.9 vs 17.7 items; P = 0.003), or used supplementary material (19.1 vs 18.0 items; P = 0.004). Variability in reporting was associated with author country (P = 0.04) but not journal (P = 0.6), abstract word count limitations (P = 0.9), PRISMA adoption (P = 0.2), structured abstracts (P = 0.2), study design (P = 0.8), subspecialty area (P = 0.09), or index test (P = 0.5).

However, the results remain inconsistent.Objectives:We conducted a meta-analysis to assess the clinical utility of miniprobe endoscopic ultrasonography for diagnostic of invasion depth of early GC.Methods:We systematically searched several online electronic databases including PubMed, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Web of Science, Embase, and Wanfang from initial library to July 20, 2018, identifying the study about miniprobe endoscopic ultrasonography for diagnostic of invasion depth of early GC. Bivariate mixed effects models were used to calculate the sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio (PLR), negative likelihood ratio (NLR), diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) with theirs 95% confidence intervals (CIs).Results:Nineteen studies with 3401 patients were included in the meta-analysis. The bivariate mixed effect model indicated that the overall diagnostic sensitivity was 0.86 (95%CI: 0.79-0.91) and the specificity was 0.73 (95%CI: 0.66-0.78). The area under the curve was 0.84 (95%CI: 0.81-0.87). We also estimated the other pooled parameters as follows: the pooled PLR was 3.13 (95%CI: 2.55-3.84), the pooled NLR was 0.19 (95%CI: 0.13-0.28), the diagnostic score was 2.78 (95%CI: 2.33-3.23), and the diagnostic odds ratio was 16.1 (95%CI: 10.23-25.36). Subgroup analysis indicated that ethnicity may be the decisive factor on heterogeneity.Conclusions:The present study indicated that the miniprobe endoscopic ultrasonography had a moderate diagnostic ability for invasion depth of early GC. The diagnostic utility was influenced by ethnicity. Further research is required to confirm the present findings and explore the potential factors of heterogeneity. © 2019 the Author(s).

Although acupuncture systematic reviews share several essential elements with other systematic reviews, some essential information for the application of acupuncture is not covered by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. Considering this, we aimed to develop an extension of the PRISMA statement for acupuncture systematic reviews. Methods: We used the PRISMA statement as a starting point, and conducted this study referring to the development strategy recommended by the EQUATOR network. The initial items were collected through a wide survey among evidence users and a review of relevant studies. We conducted a three-round Delphi survey and one-day face-to-face meeting to select items and formulate the checklist. After the consensus meeting, we drafted the manuscript (including the checklist) and sent it to our advisory experts for comments, following which the checklist was refined and circulated to a group of acupuncture systematic review authors for pilot test. We also selected a sample of acupuncture systematic reviews published in 2017 to test the checklist. Results: A checklist of five new sub-items (including sub items) and six modified items was formulated, involving content related to title, rationale, eligibility criteria, literature search, data extraction, and study characteristics. We clarified the rationales of the items and provided examples for each item for additional guidance. Conclusion: The PRISMA for Acupuncture checklist is developed for improving the reporting of systematic reviews of acupuncture interventions.

""Mapping"" onto generic preference-based outcome measures is increasingly being used as a means of generating health utilities for use within health economic evaluations. Despite the publication of technical guides for the conduct of mapping research, guidance for the reporting of mapping studies is currently lacking. The MAPS (MApping onto Preference-based measures reporting Standards) statement is a new checklist that aims to promote complete and transparent reporting of mapping studies. Methods. In the absence of previously published reporting checklists or reporting guidance documents, a de novo list of reporting items was created by a working group comprised of 6 health economists and 1 Delphi methodologist. A 2-round, modified Delphi survey with representatives from academia, consultancy, health technology assessment agencies, and the biomedical journal editorial community was used to identify a list of essential reporting items from this larger list. Results. From the initial de novo list of 29 candidate items, a set of 23 essential reporting items was developed. The items are presented numerically and categorized within 6 sections, namely: (i) title and abstract; (ii) introduction; (iii) methods; (iv) results; (v) discussion; and (vi) other. The MAPS statement is best applied in conjunction with the accompanying MAPS explanation and elaboration document. Conclusions. It is anticipated that the MAPS statement will improve the clarity, transparency, and completeness of reporting of mapping studies. To facilitate dissemination and uptake, the MAPS statement is being co-published by 7 health economics and quality-of-life journals, and broader endorsement is encouraged. The MAPS working group plans to assess the need for an update of the reporting checklist in 5 years. © The Author(s) 2014.",,10.1177/0272989X15598332,,NA,NA,preferred reporting items for studies mapping onto preferencebased outcome measures the maps statement

Oversimplification and inconsistencies in reporting about complex interventions can limit the usability of review findings. Rationale Although guidance exists to ensure that reports of individual studies and systematic reviews adhere to accepted scientific standards, their design-specific focus leaves important reporting gaps relative to complex interventions in health care. This paper provides a stand-alone extension to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) reporting tool for complex interventions—PRISMA-CI—to help authors, publishers, and readers understand and apply to systematic reviews of complex interventions. Discussion PRISMA-CI development followed the Enhancing the QUAlity and Transparency Of health Research Network guidance for extensions and focused on adding or modifying only essential items that are truly unique to complex interventions and are not covered by broader interpretation of current PRISMA guidance.

However, poor conduct or reporting of SRs and MAs may reduce their utility. The PRISMA Statement (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) was developed to help authors report their SRs and MAs adequately. Objectives: Our objectives were to (1) evaluate the quality of reporting of SRs and MAs and their abstracts in otorhinolaryngologic literature using the PRISMA and PRISMA for Abstracts checklists, respectively, (2) compare the quality of reporting of SRs and MAs published in Ear Nose Throat (ENT) journals to the quality of SRs and MAs published in the 'gold standard' Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR), and (3) formulate recommendations to improve reporting of SRs and MAs in ENT journals. Methods: On September 3, 2014, we searched the Pubmed database using a combination of filters to retrieve SRs and MAs on otorhinolaryngologic topics published in 2012 and 2013 in the top 5 ENT journals (ISI Web of Knowledge 2013) or CDSR and relevant articles were selected. We assessed how many, and which, PRISMA (for Abstracts) items were reported adequately per journal type. Results: We identified large differences in the reporting of individual items between the two journal types with room for improvement. In general, SRs and MAs published in ENT journals (n = 31) reported a median of 54.4% of the PRISMA items adequately, whereas the 49 articles published in the CDSR reported a median of 100.0 adequately (difference statistically significant, p < 0.001). For abstracts, medians of 41.7%for ENT journals and 75.0% for the CDSR were found (p < 0.001). Conclusion: The reporting of SRs and MAs in ENT journals leaves room for improvement and would benefit if the PRISMA Statement were endorsed by these journals.

However, the clinical significance of APC promoter methylation in HCC remains unclear. This meta-analysis was conducted to assess the relationship between APC promoter methylation and clinicopathological characteristics of patients with HCC. Methods: Eligible publications were identified by online electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, EBSCO and the Cochrane Library). The combined odds ratios (ORs) with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated and summarized under the random-effects model. Results: Final 21 available studies were included in the current study. APC promoter methylation was significantly higher in HCC than in normal live tissues, liver cirrhosis, and healthy blood samples (OR =11.46, P < 0.001; OR =6.04, P < 0.001; OR =93.83, P < 0.001; respectively). No significant correlation was found between HCC and chronic hepatitis, and dysplastic nodules (P > 0.1). APC promoter methylation was shown to be associated with hepatitis B virus (HBV), and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection status of patients with HCC (OR =2.86, P=0.005; OR =3.50, P=0.001; respectively), but not correlated with clinical stage, gender, and vascular invasion status (P > 0.1). Conclusions: APC promoter methylation may be correlated with HCC, especially for patients with HBV and HCV infection status. Promoter methylation of the APC may be a potential noninvasive biomarker using blood samples in the detection of HCC. More studies with large samples sizes are needed to validate our findings in the future. © Translational Cancer Research.

Adenoidectomy and tonsillectomy were recommended for the promotion of balanced dentition growth in these children. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of adenoidectomy and tonsillectomy on the growth of dental morphology in children with airway obstruction. Methods:A comprehensive search of the Medline, Embase, Web of science, and OVID databases for studies published through to January 17, 2016 was conducted. Prospective, comparative, clinical studies assessing the efficacy of adenoidectomy, or tonsillectomy in children with airway obstruction were included. The weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were used for continuous variables. Forest plots were drawn to demonstrate effects in the meta-analyses. Results: Eight papers were included in our study. We found that adenoidectomy and tonsillectomy led to a significant change in nasal-breathing in children with airway obstruction. Children with airway obstruction had a significantly narrower posterior maxillary dental arch than children without airway obstruction (WMD=-0.94, 95% CI [-1.13,-0.76]; P<0.001). After surgery, these children still had a significantly narrower dental arch than the nasal-breathing children (WMD=-0.60, 95% CI [-0.79,-0.42]; P<0.001). In terms of dental arch width, malocclusion, palatal height, overjet, overbite, dental arch perimeter, and arch length, a tendency toward normalization was evident following adenoidectomy or tonsillectomy, with no significant differences evident between the surgical group and the normal group. The small number of studies and lack of randomized controlled trials were the main limitations of this meta-analysis. Conclusions: Following adenoidectomy and tonsillectomy, the malocclusion and narrow arch width of children with airway obstruction could not be completely reversed. Therefore, other treatments such as functional training or orthodontic maxillary widening should be considered after removing the obstruction in the airway. Copyright © 2016 the Author(s).

Seven extensions to the PRISMA Statement have been published to address the reporting of different types or aspects of SRs, and another eight are in development. We performed a scoping review to map the research that has been conducted to evaluate the uptake and impact of the PRISMA Statement and extensions. We also synthesised studies evaluating how well SRs published after the PRISMA Statement was disseminated adhere to its recommendations. Methods: We searched for meta-research studies indexed in MEDLINE® from inception to 31 July 2017, which investigated some component of the PRISMA Statement or extensions (e.g. SR adherence to PRISMA, journal endorsement of PRISMA). One author screened all records and classified the types of evidence available in the studies. We pooled data on SR adherence to individual PRISMA items across all SRs in the included studies and across SRs published after 2009 (the year PRISMA was disseminated). Results: We included 100 meta-research studies. The most common type of evidence available was data on SR adherence to the PRISMA Statement, which has been evaluated in 57 studies that have assessed 6487 SRs. The pooled results of these studies suggest that reporting of many items in the PRISMA Statement is suboptimal, even in the 2382 SRs published after 2009 (where nine items were adhered to by fewer than 67% of SRs). Few meta-research studies have evaluated the adherence of SRs to the PRISMA extensions or strategies to increase adherence to the PRISMA Statement and extensions. Conclusions: Many studies have evaluated how well SRs adhere to the PRISMA Statement, and the pooled result of these suggest that reporting of many items is suboptimal. An update of the PRISMA Statement, along with a toolkit of strategies to help journals endorse and implement the updated guideline, may improve the transparency of SRs. © 2017 The Author(s).",,10.1186/s13643-017-0663-8,,29258593,NA,evaluations of the uptake and impact of the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and metaanalyses prisma statement and extensions a scoping review

All randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing Aidi injection plus platinum-based chemotherapy versus platinum-based chemotherapy, with efficacy and safety outcomes were selected. Disease Control Rate (DCR) was the primary outcome, Objective Response Rate (ORR), survival rate, quality of life (QOL), and toxic effects were the secondary outcomes. Results: 42 RCTs recruiting 4081 patients with stage IIIB/IV NSCLC were included, with overall low-moderate methodological quality. Compared with platinum-based chemotherapy alone, Aidi injection plus platinum-based chemotherapy can increase relative benefit of DCR (RR = 1.13, 95% CI 1.09–1.16, P < 0.00001), ORR (RR = 1.26, 95% CI 1.18–1.36, P < 0.00001), improve 1-, 2-, 3-year survival rates (RR = 1.14, 95% CI 1.02–1.28, P = 0.03; RR = 1.31, 95% CI 1.05–1.64, P = 0.02; and RR = 1.88, 95% CI 1.32–2.67, P = 0.0005, respectively), QOL (RR = 1.80, 95% CI 1.61–2.01, P < 0.00001), and reduce severe (grade 3 and 4) toxicities by 36% (RR = 0.64, 95% CI 0.58–0.70, P < 0.00001). Conclusions: From the available evidence, compared with platinum-based chemotherapy alone, Aidi injection plus platinum-based chemotherapy improves the clinical efficacy and alleviates the toxicity of chemotherapy in patients with stage IIIB/IV NSCLC. However, considering the intrinsic limitations of the included RCTs, well-designed, rigorously performed, high-quality trials are still required to further assess and confirm the results. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",,10.1016/j.jep.2018.04.013,,29655852,NA,aidi injection plus platinumbased chemotherapy for stage iiibiv nonsmall cell lung cancer a metaanalysis of 42 rcts following the prisma guidelines
rayyan-108684215,Significant treatment effect of bupropion in patients with bipolar disorder but similar phase-shifting rate as other antidepressants: A meta-analysis following the PRISMA guidelines,2016,1,1,,257974,95,13,,Li D.-J. and Tseng P.-T. and Chen Y.-W. and Wu C.-K. and Lin P.-Y.,NA,,Lippincott Williams and Wilkins,,"Bupropion is widely used for treating bipolar disorder (BD), and especially those with depressive mood, based on its good treatment effect, safety profile, and lower risk of phase shifting. However, increasing evidence indicates that the safety of bupropion in BD patients may not be as good as previously thought. The aim of this study was to summarize data on the treatment effect and safety profile of bupropion in the treatment of BD via a metaanalysis. Electronic search through PubMed and ClinicalTrials.gov was performed. The inclusion criteria were: (i) studies comparing changes in disease severity before and after bupropion treatment or articles comparing the treatment effect of bupropion in BD patients with those receiving other standard treatments; (ii) articles on clinical trials in humans. The exclusion criteria were (i) case reports/series, and (ii) nonclinical trials. All effect sizes from 10 clinical trials were pooled using a random effects model. We examined the possible confounding variables using meta-regression and subgroup analysis. Bupropion significantly improved the severity of disease in BD patients (P<0.001), and the treatment effect was similar to other antidepressants/standard treatments (P=0.220). There were no significant differences in the dropout rate (P=0.285) and rate of phase shifting (P=0.952) between BD patients who received bupropion and those who received other antidepressants. We could not perform a detailed meta-analysis of every category of antidepressant, nor could we rule out the possible confounding effect of concurrent psychotropics or include all drug side effects. Furthermore, the number of studies recruited in the meta-analysis was relatively small. Our findings reconfirm the benefits of bupropion for the treatment of bipolar depression, which are similar to those of other antidepressants. However, the rate of phase shifting with bupropion usage was not as low compared to other antidepressants as previously thought, which should serve to remind clinicians of the risk of phase shifting when prescribing bupropion to BD patients regardless of the suggestions of current clinical practice guidelines.

Available guidelines, including PRISMA-P (2015) and PRISMA (2009), do not cover all the complexities associated with reporting systematic reviews in the paediatric population. Using a collaborative, multidisciplinary structure, we aim to develop evidence-based and consensus-based PRISMA-P-C (Protocol for Children) and PRISMA-C (Children) Extensions to guide paediatric systematic review protocol and completed review reporting. Methods and analysis: This project's methodology follows published recommendations for developing reporting guidelines and involves the following six phases; (1) establishment of a steering committee representing key stakeholder groups; (2) a scoping review to identify potential Extension items; (3) three types of consensus activities including meetings of the steering committee to achieve high-level decisions on the content and methodology of the Extensions, a survey of key stakeholders to generate a list of possible items to include in the Extensions and a formal consensus meeting to select the reporting items to add to, or modify for, the Extension; (4) the preliminary checklist items generated in phase III will be evaluated against the existing evidence and reporting practices in paediatric systematic reviews; (5) extension statements and explanation and elaboration documents will provide detailed advice for each item and examples of good reporting; (6) development and implementation of effective knowledge translation of the extension checklist, and an evaluation of the Extensions by key stakeholders. Ethics and Dissemination: This protocol was considered a quality improvement project by the Hospital for Sick Children's Ethics Committee and did not require ethical review.

We searched electronic databases and bibliographies of relevant papers to identify studies comparing magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) with placebo or other treatments in patients at high risk of preterm labor and reporting effects and safety of MgSO4 for antenatal infants. Then, we did this meta-analysis based on PRISMA guideline. The primary outcomes included fatal death, cerebral palsy (CP), intraventricular hemorrhage, and periventricular leukomalacia. Secondary outcomes included various neonatal and maternal outcomes. Ten studies including 6 randomized controlled trials and 5 cohort studies, and involving 18,655 preterm infants were analyzed. For the rate of moderate to severe CP,MgSO4 showed the ability to reduce the risk and achieved statistically significant difference (odd ratio [OR] 0.61, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.42-0.89, P = 0.01). The comparison of mortality rate between the MgSO4 group and the placebo group only presented small difference clinically, but reached no statistical significance (OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.77-1.11, P = 0.39). Summarily, the analysis of adverse effects on babies showed no margin (P>0.05). Yet for mothers, MgSO4 exhibited obvious side-effects, such as respiratory depression, nausea and so forth, but there exited great heterogeneity. MgSO4 administered to women at high risk of preterm labor could reduce the risk of moderate to severe CP, without obvious adverse effects on babies. Although there exit many unfavorable effects on mothers, yet they may be lessened through reduction of the dose of MgSO4 and could be tolerable for mothers. So MgSO4 is both beneficial and safety to be used as a neuroprotective agent for premature infants before a valid alternative was discovered. © 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

However, few authors have contributed to the problems of safety in pure linear motion, i.e. a prismatic joint, in contrast to rotary motion. The contribution of this work is to present a new design that is capable of achieving, passively, an implementation of nonlinear elastic behavior for prismatic joints—the so-called Prismatic Compliant Joint (PCJ). This new device is based on the association of a six-bar mechanism with a linear spring. Hence, this structure generates a nonlinear stiffness behavior under a specified external force. The elastic characteristics of the PCJ are derived from a generic biological muscle mechanical behavior model and then customized according to the force-safety criteria of physical Human/Robot Interaction (pHRI) into a Hunt–Crossley contact model. A further investigation is carried out, via simulation, to verify the shock absorption capacity of the PCJ with a dummy head obstacle. In order to fit the PCJ response curve to the established safety measures, an optimization based on a genetic algorithm method is employed to tune the PCJ's intrinsic parameters subject to some chosen constraints. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",,10.1016/j.robot.2018.01.008,,NA,NA,complete design methodology of biomimetic safety device for cobots prismatic joints

This study was first determined to evaluate the clinical effects of p53 expression in SCC of the sinonasal tract. Methods: According to the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement criteria, the potential literature was searched from diverse databases. The pooled odds ratios (ORs) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to assess the strength of association between p53 expression and SNSCC. Results: Final 17 eligible studies were included in a total of 258 cases and 748 controls. The result of p53 expression was shown to be notably higher in SNSCC than in benign sinonasal papillomas and normal sinonasal mucosa (OR=26.93, P<0.001; OR=39.79, P<0.001; respectively). Subgroup analyses of ethnicity revealed that p53 expression had significant association with SNSCC in Asian and Caucasian populations in cancer versus benign sinonasal papillomas or normal sinonasal mucosa. The expression of p53 was notably higher in moderately or poorly differentiated SNSCC than in well-differentiated SNSCC (OR=3.51, P=0.021), while p53 expression was not associated with histological type. Conclusion: The results suggested that p53 overexpression may be correlated with the carcinogenesis and progression of SNSCC. The p53 gene may become a novel drug target of SNSCC. Additional studies on the correlation of p53 expression with clinicopathological features are needed. © Copyright 2017 the Author(s).

A fully recursive literature search of the primary electronic databases for available trials was performed. The objective response rate (ORR) and the median progression-free survival (PFS) of clinical responses were considered the main endpoints to evaluate the efficacy, whereas Grade 3-4 adverse effects (AEs) were analyzed to evaluate safety. The ORR of PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors was 30% (95% CI: 25- 35%). No significant difference in the ORR was observed after the comparisons of low-dose, median-dose, and high-dose cohorts. In addition, the rate of Grade 3-4 AEs was 9% (95% CI: 6-12%). According to the 3 randomized controlled trials that compared PD-1 inhibitors with chemotherapy, the difference between these 2 groups was found to be statistically significant with respect to the ORR, PFS and the incidence of Grade 3-4 AEs; that is, the relative risk (RR) of the ORR was 3.42 (95% CI: 2.49-4.69, P<0.001), the hazard ratio (HR) of the PFS was 0.50 (95% CI: 0.44-0.58, P<0.001), and the RR of Grade 3-4 AEs was 0.45 (95% CI: 0.31-0.65, P<0.001).

Therefore, often prismatic flexure hinges with basic cut-out geometries are used as revolute joints to realize an approximated rotation of a few degrees. Since the motion range and precision of a compliant mechanism depend on the flexure hinge design, the contour and hinge dimensions have to be considered as free parameters for the synthesis. Regarding this, polynomial contours are particularly suitable because they allow a simple modelling and a variable design too. In this paper, novel design guidelines for compliant mechanisms with identical or different polynomial contours are presented based on the rigid-body replacement synthesis method. Using the example of a compliant slider-crank mechanism it will be shown that the stress and path accuracy for the rectilinear guiding of a coupler point can be improved by using a look-up table and design graph instead of a multi-criteria optimization.",,10.6567/IFToMM.14TH.WC.PS10.008,,NA,NA,synthesis of compliant mechanisms based on goaloriented design guidelines for prismatic flexure hinges with polynomial contours

However, the clinical significance of CDH gene methylation in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unclear. Methods: Based on the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement criteria, available studies were identified from online electronic database. The overall odds ratio (OR) and the corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were calculated and analyzed. Results: A total of 29 eligible studies with 2562 HCC samples and 1685 controls were included. E-cadherin (CDH1) hypermethylation was observed to be significantly higher in HCC than in benign, adjacent, or normal samples. Moreover, CDH1 hypermethylation was not associated with gender, tumor grade, clinical stage, hepatitis B virus (HBV), or hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in HCC patients. H-cadherin (CDH13), protocadherin-10 (PCDH10), P-cadherin (CDH3), and CDH15 methylation may have an increased risk of HCC in fewer than 4 studies, and methylated CDH8 and CDH11 had a similar OR in HCC and adjacent samples. When HCC samples were compared with normal samples, the analysis of sample type revealed a significantly higher OR in normal blood samples than in normal tissues for hypermethylated CDH1 (50.82 vs 4.44). Conclusion:CDH1 hypermethylation may play a key role in the carcinogenesis of HCC. However, CDH1 hypermethylation was not correlated with clinicopathological features. Methylated CDH13, PCDH10, CDH3, and CDH15, but not methylated CDH8 or CDH11, may lead to an increased risk of HCC. Hypermethylated CDH1 may become a noninvasive blood biomarker.

Methods We searched PubMed, EMbase, The Cochrane Library (Issue 10, 2013), CBM, WanFang Data and CNKI, to collect relevant literature about the application of PRISMA during 2009-2013. Two reviewers independently screened literature according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, extracted data, and then bibliometric analysis was performed using Excel software. Results We finally included 175 papers, including 26 conference abstracts and 149 full texts. The results of bibliometric analysis of full texts showed that, they were published in 118 journals, and PRISMA official website announced that 176 journals endorsed the application of PRISMA. According to study type, there were 111 systematic reviews and meta-analyses (SRs/MAs) for development and reporting, 20 overviews of SRs for reporting quality assessments, 7 versions of PRISMA interpretation, and 11 articles of other kinds. In 131 SRs/MAs as well as overviews, the studies about western medicine accounted for 77.8%, followed by public health (8.4%), and traditional Chinese medicine (4.6%). Conclusion The application of PRISMA statement is still at the first phase and mainly confined to the field of western medicine, which needs more attention and understanding.

The inclusion criteria were as follows: articles with relevance to comparisons of BMD in patients with schizophrenia (SCHIZ) and healthy controls (HCs), or articles discussing comparisons of BMD in SCHIZ receiving prolactin-raising (PR) and prolactin-sparing (PS) antipsychotics; articles about clinical trials. In the current meta-analysis, we used the random-effect model to pool the results from 13 studies comparing BMD in SCHIZ and in HCs, and the results from 7 studies comparing BMD in patients receiving PR and PS. Our results revealed significantly lower BMD in SCHIZ than in HCs (P<0.001). In the meta-regression, mean age of subjects modulated the difference in BMD between patients and control subjects (P<0.001). In addition, the BMD in SCHIZ taking PR was significantly lower than in those taking PS (P=0.006). Our study can only point to the phenomenon that BMD in SCHIZ is lower than that in HCs, and cannot reveal any possible pathophysiology or mechanism of this phenomenon. In addition, we could not rule out the possible effect of medication on BMD based on the results of the metaanalysis of comparison of BMD in SCHIZ receiving PR and PS. The main result of our meta-analysis suggests that BMD is signifi-cantly lower in SCHIZ than in HCs.

The aim was to compare the quality of reporting of abstracts of SRs including meta-analysis published in high-impact general medicine journals before and after publication of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) extension for abstracts (PRISMA-A) released in April 2013. Methods: SRs including meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials published in 2012, 2014, and 2015 in top-tier general medicine journals were searched in PubMed. Data was selected and extracted by two reviewers based on the PRISMA-A guidelines which recommend to include 12 items. The primary outcome was the adjusted mean number of items reported; the secondary outcome was the reporting of each item and factors associated with a better reporting. Adjustment was made for abstract word count and format, number of authors, PRISMA endorsement, and publication on behalf of a group. Results: We included 84 abstracts from 2012, 59 from 2014, and 61 from 2015. The mean number of items reported in 2015 (7.5; standard deviation [SD] 1.6) and in 2014 (6.8; SD 1.6) differed and did not differ from that reported in 2012 (7.2; SD 1.7), respectively; adjusted mean difference: 0.9 (95 % CI 0.4; 1.3) and -0.1 (95 % CI -0.6; 0.4). From 2012 to 2014, the quality of reporting was in regression for ""strengths and limitations of evidence"" and ""funding""; contrariwise, it remained unchanged for the others items. Between 2012 and 2015, the quality of reporting rose up for ""description of the effect"", ""synthesis of results"", ""interpretation"", and ""registration""; but decreased for ""strengths and limitations of evidence""; it remained unchanged for the other items. The overall better reporting was associated with abstracts structured in the 8-headings format in 2014 and abstracts with a word count <300 in 2014 and 2015. Conclusions: Not surprisingly, the quality of reporting did not improve in 2014 and suboptimally improved in 2015. There is still room for improvement to meet the standards of PRISMA-A guidelines. Stricter adherence to these guidelines by authors, reviewers, and journal editors is highly warranted and will surely contribute to a better reporting. © 2016 The Author(s).",,10.1186/s13643-016-0356-8,,NA,NA,a comparison of quality of abstracts of systematic reviews including metaanalysis of randomized controlled trials in highimpact general medicine journals before and after the publication of prisma extension for abstracts a systematic review and metaanalysis

Can Aidi injection alleviate the toxicity and improve the clinical efficacy of radiotherapy in lung cancer? Has Aidi injection the attenuation and synergistic efficacy to radiotherapy? There is lack of strong evidence to prove it. Objectives: To reveal its real attenuation and synergistic efficacy to radiotherapy and provide sufficient evidence for adjuvant chemotherapy strategies to lung cancer, we systematically evaluated all related studies. DataSources:We collected all studies about Aidi injection plus radiotherapy for lung cancer in Medline, Embase, Web of Science, China national knowledge infrastructure database (CNKI), Chinese scientific journals full-text database (VIP), Wanfang database, China biological medicine database (CBM) (established to June 2015), and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (June 2015), evaluated their quality according to the Cochrane evaluation handbook of randomized controlled trials (5.1.0), extracted data following the PICO principles and synthesized the data by Meta analysis. Results: Sixteen randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with 1192 lung cancer patients were included, with general methodological quality in most trials. The merged relative risk (RR) values and their 95% CI of meta-analysis for objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), and quality of life (QOL) were as follows: 1.54, (1.39,1.70), 1.10 (1.02, 1.19), and 2.13 (1.68, 2.68). The merged RR values and their 95% CI of meta-analysis for myelosuppression and neutropenia, radiation pneumonitis, and radiation esophagitis were as follows: 0.51 (0.38, 0.69), 0.53 (0.42, 0.65), 0.52 (0.41, 0.67), and 0.52 (0.40, 0.68). All were statistically significant. The possibility of publication bias was small which objectively reported the results. Conclusions: The evidence available indicates that Aidi injection plus radiotherapy can significantly improve the clinical efficacy and QOL of patients with lung cancer.

However, the role of CDH13 promoter methylation status in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) remains to be clarified. Methods: Eligible articles were identified from online electronic database based on the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement criteria. The pooled odds ratio (OR) and the corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were calculated and analyzed. Results: Eventually, a total of nine studies were included in this meta-analysis, including 488 CRC, 298 adjacent, 144 normal, 68 premalignant tissues. The results demonstrated that CDH13 promoter methylation was notably higher in CRC than in normal, adjacent, and premalignant tissues (cancer tissues vs normal tissues: OR=16.94, P<0.001; cancer tissues vs adjacent tissues: OR=20.06, P<0.001; cancer tissues vs premalignant tissues: OR=2.23, P=0.038). CDH13 promoter methylation had a significantly increased risk for poorly differentiated CRC (OR=4.07, P=0.001). CDH13 promoter methylation was not associated with sex status, tumor stage, and lymph node status (all P>0.05). One study with 85 CRC patients reported that CDH13 promoter methylation was correlated with poor prognosis in overall survival (OS). Conclusions: CDH13 promoter methylation may play an important role in the initiation and progression of CRC, and may be correlated with OS of patients with CRC. Additional studies with large sample sizes are needed to further confirm our findings in the future. Copyright © 2017 the Author(s).

Systematic reviews often compound poor reporting of harms in primary studies by failing to report harms or doing so inadequately. While the PRISMA statement (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) helps systematic review authors ensure complete and transparent reporting, it is focused mainly on efficacy. Thus, a PRISMA harms checklist has been developed to improve harms reporting in systematic reviews, promoting a more balanced assessment of benefits and harms. METHODS: A development strategy, endorsed by the EQUATOR Network and existing reporting guidelines (including the PRISMA statement, PRISMA for abstracts, and PRISMA for protocols), was used. After the development of a draft checklist of items, a modified Delphi process was initiated. The Delphi consisted of three rounds of electronic feedback followed by an in-person meeting. RESULTS: The PRISMA harms checklist contains four essential reporting elements to be added to the original PRISMA statement to improve harms reporting in reviews. These are reported in the title (""Specifically mention 'harms' or other related terms, or the harm of interest in the review""), synthesis of results (""Specify how zero events were handled, if relevant""), study characteristics (""Define each harm addressed, how it was ascertained (eg, patient report, active search), and over what time period""), and synthesis of results (""Describe any assessment of possible causality""). Additional guidance regarding existing PRISMA items was developed to demonstrate relevance when synthesising information about harms. CONCLUSION: The PRISMA harms checklist identifies a minimal set of items to be reported when reviewing adverse events. This guideline extension is intended to improve harms reporting in systematic reviews, whether harms are a primary or secondary outcome. © BMJ Publishing Group Ltd 2016.",,10.1136/bmj.i157,,26830668,NA,prisma harms checklist improving harms reporting in systematic reviews

XRCC1 is one of important molecular markers for BER. So far, the role of XRCC1 polymorphisms with clinical outcomes of advanced NSCLC treated with platinum-based chemotherapy is inconclusive. To explore the relationship between XRCC1 polymorphisms and platinum-based chemotherapy in advanced NSCLC patients, we performed this meta-analysis. Methods: Crude odds ratios (ORs), Cox proportional hazard ratios (HRs) with the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were adopted to assess the strength of association between XRCC1 polymorphisms and response rate, Overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS) of advanced NSCLC treated with platinum-based chemotherapy. Q test and I 2 test were used for the assessment of heterogeneity. Subgroup analyses were conducted when heterogeneity exists. Begg's funnel plots and Egger's linear regression test were used to estimate publication bias. Sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the stability of the result. Results: A total of 19 studies including 2815 individuals were eligible for the analysis, results showed XRCC1 194Arg allele was negatively associated with the objective response rate relative to 194Trp, and results of homozygous model, dominant model and heterozygous model suggested a gene dosage effect negative correlation between 194Arg allele and objective response rate(ArgArg vs TrpTrp: OR = 0.64(95%CI: 0.44-0.91); ArgArg + TrpArg vs TrpTrp: OR = 0.79(95%CI: 0.57-1.11); TrpArg vs TrpTrp: OR = 1.05(95%CI: 0.73-1.51)). XRCC1 399Gln may indicate favorable overall survival (GlnGln + GlnArg vs ArgArg: HR = 0.65(95%CI: 0.43-0.98)) and favorable PFS (GlnGln vs ArgArg: HR = 0.72(95%CI: 0.48-0.97)) in Asian patients; while in Caucasian patients, XRCC1 399Gln indicated poorer overall survival (GlnGln vs ArgArg: HR = 2.29(95%CI: 1.25-3.33)). Conclusions: Our results indicated that in NSCLC patients treated with platinum-based regimen, XRCC1 194Arg allele suggest poor objective response rate, the GlnGln genotype of XRCC1 399 suggest poorer overall survival in Caucasian patients, and longer PFS in Asian patients. © 2017 The Author(s).",,10.1186/s12885-017-3487-y,,28743242,NA,association between the xrcc1 polymorphisms and clinical outcomes of advanced nsclc treated with platinumbased chemotherapy a metaanalysis based on the prisma statement

They are an increasingly important tool within evidence-based medicine, guiding clinical practice, future research, and health care policy. OBJECTIVE: To determine the reporting quality of recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses in plastic surgery with the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement. METHODS: MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched for systematic reviews published between January 1, 2013, and December 31,2014, in 5 major plastic surgery journals. Screening, identification, and data extraction were performed independently by 2 teams. Articles were reviewed for compliance with reporting of 27 items in the PRISMA checklist. Data analysis was conducted from January 1 to July 30, 2015. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The sum of PRISMA checklist items (1-27) per systematic review. RESULTS: From an initial set of 163 articles, 79 met the inclusion criteria. The median PRISMA score was 16 of 27 items (59%) (range, 6%-26%; 95% CI, 14%-17%). Compliance varied between individual PRISMA items. It was poorest for items related to the use of review protocol (item 5; 4 articles [5%]) and presentation of data on the risk of bias of each study (item 19; 14 articles [18%]). Compliance was the highest for description of rationale (item 3; 78 articles [99%]), sources offundingand other support (item 27; 75 articles [95%]), and inclusion of a structured summary in the abstract (item 2; 75 articles [95%]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The reporting quality of systematic reviews in plastic surgery requires improvement. Enforcement of compliance through journal submission systems, as well as improved education, awareness, and a cohesive strategy among all stakeholders, is called for.

They have increasingly become the subject of systematic reviews and are challenging to effectively report. The Complex Interventions Methods Workgroup developed an extension to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses for Complex Interventions (PRISMA-CI). Rationale Following the EQUATOR Network guidance for Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis extensions, this Explanation and Elaboration (EE) document accompanies the PRISMA-CI checklist to promote consistency in reporting of systematic reviews of complex interventions.

Reporting quality of reviews is of critical importance in order to judge the quality and risk of bias in a review to ensure sound healthcare decisions are made. This is particularly important in the field of dermatology due to the growing number of systematic reviews and their key role in informing healthcare decision within dermatology. A contemporary and comprehensive review of the compliance of dermatology systematic reviews and meta-analyses with the PRISMA checklist, in the highest impact factor dermatology journals, has not yet been assessed. To our knowledge, our review represents the most extensive study assessing reporting quality of systematic reviews and meta-analyses published within dermatology to date. Methods and analysis: Our protocol is reported in line with the Preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta-analysis protocols (PRISMA-P) 2015 guidelines. MEDLINE will be searched to look for systematic reviews and meta-analysis in selected years within the top four highest impact factor dermatology journals in 2017. Records and full texts will be screened independently by five researchers. Data will be extracted onto a standard data extraction database. A training session will take place to ensure accurate data extraction and scoring of studies with the PRISMA checklist. The data will be analysed and outcomes will be determined. Primary outcome will be the compliance of reviews with the PRISMA checklist. © 2018",,10.1016/j.isjp.2018.11.001,,NA,NA,assessing the compliance of systematic review articles published in leading dermatology journals with the prisma statement guidelines a systematic review protocol
rayyan-108684253,Preferred reporting items for a systematic review and meta-analysis of individual participant data: The PRISMA-IPD statement,2015,1,1,,987484,313,16,,Stewart L.A. and Clarke M. and Rovers M. and Riley R.D. and Simmonds M. and Stewart G. and Tierney J.F.,NA,,American Medical Association,,"IMPORTANCE: Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of individual participant data (IPD) aim to collect, check, and reanalyze individual-level data from all studies addressing a particular research question and are therefore considered a gold standard approach to evidence synthesis. They are likely to be used with increasing frequency as current initiatives to share clinical trial data gain momentum and may be particularly important in reviewing controversial therapeutic areas. OBJECTIVE: to develop PRISMA-IPD as a stand-alone extension to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) Statement, tailored to the specific requirements of reporting systematic reviews and meta-analyses of IPD. Although developed primarily for reviews of randomized trials, many items will apply in other contexts, including reviews of diagnosis and prognosis. DESIGN Development of PRISMA-IPD followed the EQUATOR Network framework guidance and used the existing standard PRISMA Statement as a starting point to draft additional relevant material. A web-based survey informed discussion at an international workshop that included researchers, clinicians, methodologists experienced in conducting systematic reviews and meta-analyses of IPD, and journal editors. The statement was drafted and iterative refinements were made by the project, advisory, and development groups. The PRISMA-IPD Development Group reached agreement on the PRISMA-IPD checklist and flow diagram by consensus. FINDINGS: Compared with standard PRISMA, the PRISMA-IPD checklist includes 3 new items that address (1) methods of checking the integrity of the IPD (such as pattern of randomization, data consistency, baseline imbalance, and missing data), (2) reporting any important issues that emerge, and (3) exploring variation (such as whether certain types of individual benefit more from the intervention than others). A further additional item was created by reorganization of standard PRISMA items relating to interpreting results.Wording was modified in 23 items to reflect the IPD approach.

Other reporting guidelines and techniques to assess methodological quality of SRs have been developed. We aimed to assess the frequency of the use of reporting and other guidelines in SRs to assess whether PRISMA is being used inappropriately as a substitute for other relevant guidelines. Methods: Web of Knowledge was searched to identify articles citing the PRISMA guidelines over a 12-month period. The use of reporting guidelines (including PRISMA and MOOSE) and tools for assessing methodological quality (including QUADAS) was assessed. Factors associated with appropriate use of guidelines including review type, field of publication and involvement of a methodologist were investigated. Results: Over the 12-month period, 701 SRs were identified. MOOSE guidelines were cited in just 17% of epidemiologic reviews; QUADAS or QUADAS-2 was referred to in just 40% of diagnostic SRs. In the multivariable analysis, medical field of publication and methodologist involvement (OR = 1.97, 95% CI: 1.37, 2.83) were significant predictors of appropriate use of guidelines. Inclusion of a meta-analysis resulted in 73% higher odds of appropriate usage of systematic review guidelines (OR = 1.73, 95% CI: 1.22, 2.35). Conclusions: Usage of SR reporting guidelines and tools for assessment of methodological quality other than PRISMA may be under-utilized with negative implications both for the reporting and methodological quality of systematic reviews. © 2014 Fleming et al.",,10.1371/journal.pone.0096407,,24788774,NA,blinded by prisma are systematic reviewers focusing on prisma and ignoring other guidelines

In light of the global commitment to health equity, we have previously developed and published a reporting guideline for equity-focused systematic reviews (PRISMA-E 2012). The objectives of this study were to explore the utility of the equity extension items included in PRISMA-E 2012 from a systematic review author perspective, including facilitators and barriers to its use. This will assist in designing dissemination and knowledge translation strategies. We conducted a survey of systematic review authors to expose them to the new items in PRISMA-E 2012, establish the extent to which they had historically addressed those items in their own reviews, and gather feedback on the usefulness of the new items. Data were analysed using Microsoft Excel 2008 and Stata (version 11.2 for Mac). Of 151 respondents completing the survey, 18.5% (95% CI: 12.7% to 25.7%) had not heard of the PRISMA statement before, although 83.4% (95% CI: 77.5% to 89.3%) indicated that they plan to use PRISMA-E 2012 in the future, depending on the focus of their review. Most (68.9%; 95% CI: 60.8% to 76.2%) thought that using PRISMA-E 2012 would lead them to conduct their reviews differently. Important facilitators to using PRISMA-E 2012 identified by respondents were journal endorsement and incorporation of the elements of the guideline into systematic review software. Barriers identified were lack of time, word limits and the availability of equity data in primary research. This study has been the first to 'road-test' the new PRISMA-E 2012 reporting guideline and the findings are encouraging. They confirm the acceptability and potential utility of the guideline to assist review authors in reporting on equity in their reviews. The uptake and impact of PRISMA-E 2012 over time on design, conduct and reporting of primary research and systematic reviews should continue to be examined. © 2013 Burford et al.",,10.1371/journal.pone.0075122,,24130684,NA,testing the prismaequity 2012 reporting guideline the perspectives of systematic review authors

Quality of conduct and reporting has been described in the rapid review literature; however, no formal assessment has been carried out using available instruments. The objective of this study was to explore compliance with conduct and reporting guidelines in rapid reviews published or posted online during 2013 and 2014. Methods: We performed a comprehensive literature search for rapid reviews using multiple bibliographic databases (e.g. PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library) through December 31, 2014. Grey literature was searched thoroughly, and health technology assessment agencies were surveyed to identify additional rapid review products. Candidate reviews were assessed for inclusion using pre-specified eligibility criteria. Detailed data was collected from the included reviews on study and reporting characteristics and variables significant to rapid reviews (e.g. nomenclature, definition). We evaluated the quality of conduct and reporting of included rapid reviews using the A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) checklists. Compliance with each checklist item was examined, and the sum of adequately reported items was used to describe overall compliance. Rapid reviews were stratified to explore differences in compliance related to publication status. The association between compliance and time to completion or length of publication was explored through univariate regression. Results: Sixty-six rapid reviews were included. There were heterogeneous nomenclature, research questions and approaches to rapid reviews. Compliance with AMSTAR and PRISMA checklists was poor. Published rapid reviews were compliant with individual PRISMA items more often than unpublished reviews, but no difference was seen in AMSTAR item compliance overall. There was evidence of an association between length of publication and time to completion and the number of adequately reported PRISMA or AMSTAR items. Conclusions: Transparency and inadequate reporting are significant limitations of rapid reviews. Scientific editors, authors and producing agencies should ensure that the reporting of conduct and findings is accurate and complete. Further research may be warranted to explore reporting and conduct guidelines specific to rapid reviews and how these guidelines may be applied across the spectrum of rapid review approaches. © 2016 Kelly et al.",,10.1186/s13643-016-0258-9,,27160255,NA,quality of conduct and reporting in rapid reviews an exploration of compliance with prisma and amstar guidelines
rayyan-108684259,New methodology for estimating the minimum design vapor pressure of prismatic pressure vessel for on-ship application,2018,1,1,,298018,158,NA,,Lee J. and Jo C. and Chang D. and Chung H.,NA,,Elsevier Ltd,,"This paper presents a methodology for estimating the minimum design vapor pressure of prismatic pressure vessels for on-ship application. Engineering authorities guide the codes for a novel concept design such as a prismatic pressure vessel using a design by analysis (DBA). DBA methods enable high efficiency because they directly calculate the loads to avoid inherent conservativeness that exists in a design by rule (DBR). However, in DBA methods, the designer should conduct a finite element analysis (FEA) and evaluate the results iteratively to meet the design criteria. In this paper, we propose a new approach to estimating the minimum vapor pressure of a prismatic pressure vessel that follows the design philosophy of an IMO Type C independent tank. The procedure of the proposed method was demonstrated based on a case study. An FEA was also conducted for verification purposes. The results show that the proposed method can effectively estimate the required minimum shell thickness and designed vapor pressure without conducting an iterative FEA. In addition, minimization of the tank shell thickness is made possible because the proposed method directly calculates the crack propagation rate to avoid an unnecessary margin while satisfying the fatigue crack propagation criteria. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",,10.1016/j.oceaneng.2018.04.008,,NA,NA,new methodology for estimating the minimum design vapor pressure of prismatic pressure vessel for onship application
rayyan-108684260,Endorsement of PRISMA statement and quality of systematic reviews and meta-analyses published in nursing journals: A cross-sectional study,2017,1,1,,20446055,7,2,,Tam W.W.S. and Lo K.K.H. and Khalechelvam P.,NA,,BMJ Publishing Group,,"Objective: Systematic reviews (SRs) often poorly report key information, thereby diminishing their usefulness. Previous studies evaluated published SRs and determined that they failed to meet explicit criteria or characteristics. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement was recommended as a reporting guideline for SR and meta-analysis (MA), but previous studies showed that adherence to the statement was not high for SRs published in different medical fields. Thus, the aims of this study are twofold: (1) to investigate the number of nursing journals that have required or recommended the use of the PRISMA statement for reporting SR, and (2) to examine the adherence of SRs and/or meta-analyses to the PRISMA statement published in nursing journals. Design: A cross-sectional study. Methods: Nursing journals listed in the ISI journal citation report were divided into 2 groups based on the recommendation of PRISMA statement in their 'Instruction for Authors'. SRs and meta-analyses published in 2014 were searched in 3 databases. 37 SRs and meta-analyses were randomly selected in each group. The adherence of each item to the PRISMA was examined and summarised using descriptive statistics. The quality of the SRs was assessed by Assessing the Methodological Quality of Systematic Reviews. The differences between the 2 groups were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test. Results: Out of 107 nursing journals, 30 (28.0%) recommended or required authors to follow the PRISMA statement when they submit SRs or meta-analyses. The median rates of adherence to the PRISMA statement for reviews published in journals with and without PRISMA endorsement were 64.9% (IQR: 17.6-92.3%) and 73.0% (IQR: 59.5-94.6%), respectively. No significant difference was observed in any of the items between the 2 groups. Conclusions: The median adherence of SRs and meta-analyses in nursing journals to PRISMA is low at 64.9% and 73.0%, respectively. Nonetheless, the adherence level of nursing journals to the PRISMA statement does not significantly vary whether they endorse or recommend such a guideline. © 2017, BMJ Publishing Group.

Systematic reviews provide Class 1 research evidence, are based upon an established rigor and communicate results in a comprehensive manner, and are therefore particularly relevant to clinicians and researchers. Clinician requirements for quality systematic reviews are twofold: to keep up to date with research and to make informed decisions including those required for diagnoses, disease or risk assessment, and treatment. Researchers rely upon quality systematic reviews to compete for diminishing research funds, prove efficacy for intervention trials, and to meet increasing demand for evidence based intervention. However, insufficient systematic reviews are undertaken, and the methodological rigor and quality are often variable. The aim of this article is to guide researchers through the iterative systematic review process in order to improve quality and thereby increase publication rates. The step by step guide provides a road map through the EQUATOR network and practical suggestions in order to meet the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) (Moher et al. 2009) as well as encouraging high standards through the use of quality rating scales.

According to the PRISMA guidelines, we undertook an updated systematic review of all of the studies that have examined, in randomized controlled trials, the efficacy and tolerability of SGAs (as either monotherapy or augmentation) in the treatment of PD, with or without other comorbid psychiatric disorders. Studies until 31 December 2015 were identified through PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase, Cochrane Library and Clinical trials.gov. Among 210 studies, five were included (two involving patients with a principal diagnosis of PD and three involving patients with bipolar disorder with comorbid PD or generalized anxiety disorder). All were eight-week trials and involved treatments with quetiapine extended release, risperidone and ziprasidone. Overall, a general lack of efficacy of SGAs on panic symptoms was observed. Some preliminary indications of the antipanic effectiveness of risperidone are insufficient to support its use in PD, primarily due to major limitations of the study. However, several methodological limitations may have negatively affected all of these studies, decreasing the validity of the results and making it difficult to draw reliable conclusions. Except for ziprasidone, SGAs were well tolerated in these short-term trials. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",,10.3390/ijms17040551,,27089322,NA,is there room for secondgeneration antipsychotics in the pharmacotherapy of panic disorder a systematic review based on prisma guidelines

Identifying the most effective ones and the patients' characteristics associated with best performance of the drugs will improve management of hypertensive patients. Objective: To assess the blood pressure (BP) reduction attributed to antihypertensive drugs and identify characteristics associated with BP decrease. Data sources: MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from inception through July 2012 and selected papers. Study eligibility criteria: Double-blind, randomized clinical trials whose main result was the reduction in BP by antihypertensive treatment, with study population ≥50 or ≥25 if the study was a crossover, follow-up of at least 8 weeks, and available required data. Study appraisal and synthesis methods: Study data were independently extracted by multiple observers and introduced in an electronic database. Inconsistencies were resolved by discussion and referral back to the original articles. Meta-analysis was performed according to PRISMA statement and using a Bayesian framework. Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s): Mean decrease in systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) achieved by each drug or combination. Results: Two hundred eight trials including 94,305 patients were identified. In monotherapy, most drugs achieved 10 to 15 mm Hg SBP and 8 to 10 mm Hg DBP decreases. Olmesartan/amlodipine, olmesartan/hydrochlorothiazide, felodipine/metoprolol, and valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide were the combinations leading to the greatest mean SBP reductions (>20 mm Hg). Female sex and body mass index >25 kg/m 2 were associated with more pronounced SBP and DBP reductions, whereas Afro-American ethnicity was associated with BP reductions smaller than the median. Results were adjusted by study duration, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes mellitus. Still, the estimation was performed using the mean administered doses, which do not exactly match those of the available drug formats. Limitations: Data corresponded to those obtained in each of the included trials; the analysis of the combinations was limited to the most recent ones; estimations were performed using the mean administered doses. Conclusions and implications: Certain drug combinations achieve BP reductions ranging from 20 to 25/10 to 15 mm Hg. Sex, ethnicity, and obesity are associated with antihypertensive response. This information can contribute to better selection of the antihypertensive drug, depending on the magnitude of pretreatment BP elevation. Guidelines should be revised.

Our aim was to evaluate the impact of PRISMA endorsement on the quality of reporting and methodological quality of systematic reviews and meta-analyses, published in journals in the field of gastroenterology and hepatology (GH). Methods: Quality of reporting and methodological quality were evaluated by assessing the adherence of papers to PRISMA checklist and AMSTAR quality scale. After identifying the GH journals which endorsed PRISMA in instructions for authors (IA), we appraised: 15 papers published in 2012 explicitly mentioning PRISMA in the full text (Group A); 15 papers from the same journals published in 2012 not explicitly mentioning PRISMA in the full text (Group B); 30 papers published the year preceding PRISMA endorsement from the same journals as above (Group C); 30 papers published in 2012 on the 10 highest impact factor journals in GH which not endorsed PRISMA (Group D). Results: PRISMA statement was referred in the IA in 9 out of 70 GH journals (12.9%). We found significant increase in overall adherence to PRISMA checklist (Group A, 90.1%; Group C, 83.1%; p = 0.003) and compliance to AMSTAR scale (Group A, 85.0%; Group C, 74.6%; p = 0.002), following the PRISMA endorsement from the nine GH journals. Explicit referencing of PRISMA in manuscript was not associated with increase in quality of reporting and methodological quality (Group A vs. B, p = 0.651, p = 0.900, respectively). Adherence to PRISMA checklist, and the compliance with AMSTAR were significantly higher in journals endorsing PRISMA compared to those not (Groups A+B vs. D; p = 0.003 and p = 0.016, respectively). Conclusion: The endorsement of PRISMA resulted in increase of both quality of reporting and methodological quality. It is advised that an increasing number of medical journals include PRISMA in the instructions for authors.

Materials and Methods: Systematic reviews and meta-analyses published in major radiology journals between January 2007 and December 2011 were identified by searching MEDLINE with the modified Montori method. Studies were reviewed independently by two investigators and assessed for adherence to the AMSTAR and PRISMA checklists. The average results were analyzed to assess for change in mean score before and after PRISMA publication and to assess results over time; a Pearson correlation coefficient was calculated to assess for any association between PRISMA and AMSTAR results. Results: Included were 130 studies from 11 journals. Average PRISMA and AMSTAR results were 21.8 of 27 and 7.2 of 11, respectively. The average result was higher after publication of PRISMA, and PRISMA-reported items were 22.6 of 27 after publication of PRISMA versus 20.9 of 27 before publication of PRISMA; AMSTAR results were 7.7 of 11 after publication of PRISMA versus 6.7 of 11 before publication of PRISMA. There was a strong positive correlation (r = 0.86) between the PRISMA and AMSTAR results. There was high variability between journals. Radiology had the highest PRISMA reported items (24.7 of 27), and American Journal of Neuroradiology had the lowest (19.6 of 27). Two major areas for improvement include study protocol registration and assessment of risk of bias across studies (ie, publication bias).

Can Aidi injection restore the cellular immunity and improve the clinical efficacy in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated with platinum-based chemotherapy? There is a lack of strong evidence to prove it. To further reveal it, we systematically evaluated all related studies. We collected all studies about the clinical efficacy and cellular immunity of Aidi injection plus platinum-based chemotherapy for NSCLC in Medline, Embase, Web of Science, China national knowledge infrastructure database (CNKI), Chinese Scientific Journals Full-Text Database (VIP), Wanfang, China biological medicine database (CBM) (established to June 2015), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CCRCT) (June 2015), Chinese clinical trial registry, and US-clinical trials (June 2015). We evaluated their quality according to the Cochrane evaluation handbook of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (5.1.0), extracted data following the patient intervention control group outcomes principles and synthesized the data by meta-analysis. Seventeen (RCTs) with 1390 NSCLC patients were included, with general methodological quality in most trials. The merged relative risk (RR) values and their 95% CI of meta-analysis for objective response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR) were as follows: 1.26 (1.12, 1.42) and 1.11(1.04, 1.17). The merged standardized mean difference (SMD) values and their 95% CI of meta-analysis for the percentage of CD3+T cells, CD4+T cells, CD8+T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and CD4+/CD8+ T cell ratio were as follows: 1.41, (0.89, 1.92), 1.59, (1.07, 2.11), 0.85, (0.38, 1.33), 1.64 (0.89, 2.39) and 0.91, (0.58, 1.24). Compared with platinum-based chemotherapy alone, all differences were statistically significant. These results might be overestimated or underestimated. Conclusions: Aidi injection plus platinum-based chemotherapy can improve the clinical efficacy of patients with NSCLC. Aidi injection could significantly restore the cellular immunity damaged by platinum-based chemotherapy. It may be an important tumor immune modulator and protector for patients with NSCLC treated with chemotherapy. Copyright © 2016 the Author(s). Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

OBJECTIVE To develop the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) diagnostic test accuracy guideline as a stand-alone extension of the PRISMA statement. Modifications to the PRISMA statement reflect the specific requirements for reporting of systematic reviews and meta-analyses of diagnostic test accuracy studies and the abstracts for these reviews. DESIGN Established standards from the Enhancing the Quality and Transparency of Health Research (EQUATOR) Network were followed for the development of the guideline. The original PRISMA statement was used as a framework on which to modify and add items. A group of 24 multidisciplinary experts used a systematic review of articles on existing reporting guidelines and methods, a 3-round Delphi process, a consensus meeting, pilot testing, and iterative refinement to develop the PRISMA diagnostic test accuracy guideline. The final version of the PRISMA diagnostic test accuracy guideline checklist was approved by the group. FINDINGS The systematic review (produced 64 items) and the Delphi process (provided feedback on 7 proposed items; 1 item was later split into 2 items) identified 71 potentially relevant items for consideration. The Delphi process reduced these to 60 items that were discussed at the consensus meeting. Following the meeting, pilot testing and iterative feedback were used to generate the 27-item PRISMA diagnostic test accuracy checklist. To reflect specific or optimal contemporary systematic review methods for diagnostic test accuracy, 8 of the 27 original PRISMA items were left unchanged, 17 were modified, 2 were added, and 2 were omitted. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The 27-item PRISMA diagnostic test accuracy checklist provides specific guidance for reporting of systematic reviews. The PRISMA diagnostic test accuracy guideline can facilitate the transparent reporting of reviews, and may assist in the evaluation of validity and applicability, enhance replicability of reviews, and make the results from systematic reviews of diagnostic test accuracy studies more useful. © 2018 American Medical Association.

The primary purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to analyze the available RCTs, comparing the effect of triclosan-coated suture with uncoated suture on the incidence of SSI after elective colorectal operations. As secondary endpoint of the analysis, we considered length of hospital stay after surgery. Methods:We performed a systematic literature review through Medline, Embase, Pubmed, Scopus, Ovid, ISI Web of Science, and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register searching for RCTs published from 1990 to 2015. To conduct these meta-analyses, we followed the guidelines and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement. Study inclusion criteria were as follows: parallel-group RCTs in adult populations reporting the closure of the abdominal wall after elective colorectal operation with triclosan-coated suture or noncoated suture, and reporting the outcomes considered in the meta-analysis. Results: Six trials including 2168 patients (1102 treated and 1066 controls) provided data on SSIs. The overall rate was 11.7% (129/1102) in the triclosan group and 13.4% (143/1066) in the control group (odds ratio 0.81, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.58-1.13, P=0.220). Heterogeneity among studies was moderate (I2=44.9%). No evidence of publication bias was detectable. Five RCTs (1783 patients; 914 treated and 689 controls) described hospital length of stay with no significant effect (mean difference: 0.02, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.07, P=0.668). The I2 test for heterogeneity was 0% (P=0.836). Moderator analyses showed no significant differences were detected in analyses comparing the suture materials (polydioxanone vs polyglactin). In open-label trials, the odds ratio for SSI risk was 0.62 (95% CI 0.20-1.93, P=0.413), 0.77 in single-blind (95% CI 0.31-1.95, P=0.583) and 0.85 in double-blind trials (95% CI 0.46-1.54, P=0.582). Conclusions: Our findings failed to demonstrate a significant protective effect of triclosan-coated sutures on the occurrence of SSI after elective colorectal resections.

The clinical outcome is controversial in trials comparing cyanoacrylate injection and band ligation. To help guide endoscopic decisions regarding acute gastric variceal bleeding, a meta-analysis was conducted. Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and ScienceDirect were searched for all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) containing the 2 interventions. The main outcomes evaluated in the meta-analysis were active bleeding control, blood transfusion, rebleeding, recurrence of varices, complications, and survival. Three RCTs were identified, which included 194 patients with active gastric variceal bleeding from Taiwan and Romania. Active bleeding control was achieved in 46 of 49 (93.9%) patients in the cyanoacrylate injection group, compared with 35 of 44 (79.5%) in the band ligation group (P=0.032), for a pooled odds ratio of 4.44 (95% confidence interval, 1.14-17.30). Rebleeding rate was comparable in type 2 gastroesophageal varices (GOV2) between the 2 interventions (35.7% vs 34.8%, P=0.895), but cyanoacrylate injection seemed superior for reducing rebleeding rate in type 1 gastroesophageal varices (GOV1, 26.1% vs 47.7%, P=0.035) and type 1 isolated gastric varices (IGV1, 17.6%vs 85.7%, P=0.015). Cyanoacrylate injection was also superior in controlling recurrence of gastric varices to band ligation (36.0% vs 66.0%, P=0.002). There was no difference in complications or mortality between the 2 interventions. The major limitation of this meta-analysis is the small number of studies/patients included. Compared with band ligation, injection cyanocrylate have an advantage in the control of acute gastric variceal bleeding, also with lower recurrence rate and rebleeding (except GOV2). The limited amount of studies included attenuates the strength of this meta-analysis; therefore, more high-quality RCTs are needed. Copyright © 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Firstly, the relevant theoretical background is summarized, closely following the theoretical derivation performed by Szalai and Papp (2010). Secondly, the required transformations for the engineering application of the design procedure are detailed and extended to arbitrary bending moment distributions. Appropriate generalized initial imperfection factors for the out-of-plane buckling of beam-columns are defined so as to achieving complete consistency across the stability verifications for columns, beams and beam-columns. The proposed procedure is subsequently validated against a large set of advanced numerical simulations. A good agreement was found between the numerical results and the estimates provided by the proposed design procedure, both in terms of the overall trend and the specific quantitative results. Based on a statistical assessment, the comparison with the interaction expression of Eurocode 3 (2005) (method 2) showed that this proposal slightly outperforms the Eurocode procedure, both in terms of average values and dispersion of results. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",,10.1016/j.jcsr.2016.10.009,,NA,NA,a consistent methodology for the outofplane buckling resistance of prismatic steel beamcolumns

Studies of ophthalmology may present additional challenges because of their potentially complex study designs. The aim of this study was to evaluate the reporting quality of systematic reviews and meta-analyses on topics in ophthalmology to determine compliance with the PRISMA guidelines. We assessed articles published between 2010 and 2015 in the five major relevant journals with the highest impact factors. Methods: The MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched to identify systematic reviews published between January 2010 and December 2015 in the following 5 major ophthalmology journals: Progress in Retinal and Eye Research, Ophthalmology, Archives of Ophthalmology, American Journal of Ophthalmology, and Survey of Ophthalmology. The screening, identification, and scoring of articles were independently performed by two teams, and the results were submitted to statistical analysis to determine medians, ranges, and 95% CIs. Results: A total of 115 articles were included. The median compliance was 15 out of 27 items (56%), the range was 5-26 (26-96%), and the inter-quartile range was 10 (37%). Compliance was highest in items related to the 'description of rationale' (item 3, 100%) and sequentially lower in 'the general interpretation of results' (item 26, 96%) and 'the inclusion of a structured summary in the abstract' (item 2, 90%). Compliance was poorest in the items 'indication of review protocol and registration' (item 5, 9%), 'specification of risk of biases that may affect the cumulative evidence' (item 15, 24%), and 'description of clear objectives in the introduction' (item 4, 26%). Conclusion: The reporting quality of systematic reviews and meta-analyses in ophthalmology should be significantly improved. While we recommend the use of the PRISMA criteria as a guideline before journal submission, additional research aimed at identifying potential barriers to compliance may be required to improve compliance with PRISMA guidelines. © 2017 The Author(s).",,10.1186/s12874-017-0450-1,,29281981,NA,compliance of systematic reviews in ophthalmology with the prisma statement

However, little is known about the possible gains that this kind of video game-based interventions can produce and even if these gains can be transferred to real life abilities. The present paper aims to uncover key information related to the use of video game in ADHD neuropsychological rehabilitation/intervention by focusing on its gains and its capability to transfer/generalize these gains to real life situation via a systematic review of the empirical literature. The PRISMA guidelines were adopted. Internet-based bibliographic searches were conducted via seven major electronic databases (i.e., PsycARTICLES, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Core Collection BIOSIS Citation Index, MEDLINE, SciELO Citation Index, and PubMed) to access studies examining the association between video game interventions in ADHD patients and behavioral and cognitive outcomes. A total of 14 empirical studies meeting the inclusion criteria were identified. The studies reported the attention, working memory, and the behavioral aspects as the main target of the intervention. Cognitive and behavioral gains were reported after the video game training (VGT). However, many bias related to the choice of outcome instruments, sampling and blindness of assessors, weaken the results power. Additional researches are important to clarify the effects and stability of the VGT programs, and an important effort should be made to construct better methods to assess improvements on everyday cognitive abilities and real world functioning. © 2015 Strahler Rivero, Herrera Nuñez, Uehara Pires and Amodeo Bueno.",,10.3389/fpsyt.2015.00151,,NA,NA,adhd rehabilitation through video gaming a systematic review using prisma guidelines of the current findings and the associated risk of bias

Compliance with recognised reporting guidelines for systematic review evidence has not been assessed. Objective To assess the compliance of systematic reviews published in craniofacial journals with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) reporting criteria. Data sources, search terms and study selection Thomson Reuters impact factor was used to identify three top craniofacial journals. A search for all systematic review articles published in these journals from 1st May 2010 to 30th April 2015 was conducted using MEDLINE PubMed. Data extraction Two independent researchers assessed each study for inclusion and performed the data extraction. Data included the article reference information; the pathology and interventions examined and compliance of each review article with the PRISMA checklist. Data synthesis and results 97 studies were returned by the search. 62 studies proceeded to data extraction. The mean percentage of applicable PRISMA items that were met across all studies was 72.5% (range 28.6–96.2%). The area of poorest compliance was with the declaration of a study protocol (19.4% of studies). Only 37.1% of studies declared their source of funding.

This study aimed to determine their relationship thorough a meta-analysis of articles on their comorbidity rate. The aim of the study is to examine the overall prevalence rate of BD in asthmatic patients and of asthma in BD patients compared to healthy controls. Electronic research of PubMed and ClinicalTrials.gov was performed. Articles discussing the prevalence rate of BD in patients with/ without asthma and the prevalence rate of asthma in those with/without BD, as well as clinical trials in humans and case-controlled trials or cohort studies, were all included. Case reports or series and nonclinical trials were excluded. Through a random-effects model, a meta-analysis of the results of 4 studies comparing the prevalence rate of BD in patients with/without asthma, and in 6 studies comparing the prevalence rate of asthma in subjects with/without BD were performed. There were significantly higher prevalence rates of BD in asthmatic patients than in healthy controls (P<0.001) and of asthma in BD patients than in healthy controls (P<0.001). Only the patient's mean age significantly modulated the odds ratio of the prevalence rate of asthma in BD patients (slope=0.015, P<0.001). Only 10 studies were included and most were cross-sectional studies. The possible confounding effect of medication on BD or asthma onset was not investigated. Any possible etiology of the comorbidity was also not determined. This meta-analysis highlights the importance of the significantly high comorbid rate of BD and asthma, and the positive association with age. Special attention must be given to the comorbidity of asthma and BD, especially in older patients. Copyright © 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

The primary objective of this study was to examine compliance of systematic reviews in veterinary journals with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines for literature search reporting and to examine the completeness, bias, and reproducibility of the searches in these reviews from what was reported. The second objective was to examine reporting of the credentials and contributions of those involved in the search process. Methods: A sample of systematic reviews or meta-analyses published in veterinary journals between 2011 and 2015 was obtained by searching PubMed. Reporting in the full text of each review was checked against certain PRISMA checklist items. Results: Over one-third of reviews (37%) did not search the CAB Abstracts database, and 9% of reviews searched only 1 database. Over two-thirds of reviews (65%) did not report any search for grey literature or stated that they excluded grey literature. The majority of reviews (95%) did not report a reproducible search strategy. Conclusions: Most reviews had significant deficiencies in reporting the search process that raise questions about how these searches were conducted and ultimately cast serious doubts on the validity and reliability of reviews based on a potentially biased and incomplete body of literature. These deficiencies also highlight the need for veterinary journal editors and publishers to be more rigorous in requiring adherence to PRISMA guidelines and to encourage veterinary researchers to include librarians or information specialists on systematic review teams to improve the quality and reporting of searches. © 2017, Medical Library Association.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the quality of meta-analyses and systematic reviews according to the Assessment of Multiple Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines in the anesthesia literature. Methods: A search was conducted to identify all meta-analyses ever been published in the British Journal of Anaesthesia (BJA), Anaesthesia, and Korean Journal of Anesthesiology (KJA) between Jan. 01, 2004 and Nov. 31, 2016. We aimed to apply the AMSTAR and PRISMA checklists to all published meta-analyses. Results: We identified 121 meta-analyses in the anesthesia literature from January 2004 through the end of November 2016 (BJA; 75, Anaesthesia; 43, KJA; 3). The number of studies published and percentage of ‘Yes’ responses for meta-analysis articles published after the year 2010 was significantly increased compared to that of studies published before the year 2009 (P = 0.014 for Anaesthesia). In the anesthesia literature as a whole, participation of statisticians as authors statistically improved average scores of PRISMA items (P = 0.004) especially in the BJA (P = 0.003).

This study describes a unified platform with Preferred Reporting Items for the Development of Evidence-based CPGs in TM (PRIDE-CPG-TM), which has been successfully used by the evidence-based CPGs committee for TM. Methods Initially we searched the literature and CPG handbooks, collected items from methodology references and drew on experiences gained from Korean medical physicians and methodology experts. A group of experts subsequently edited drafts of the items, identified one or more examples of good reporting for each item, and developed text that explained the rationale and discussed relevant evidence. Face to face meetings were held with experts to finalize the items with the most extensive elaboration. Results The PRIDE-CPG-TM, in the form of a checklist and description of items with TM approach and TM examples, were designed to improve the reporting of CPG in TM and thereby facilitate their interpretation and replication. The PRIDE-CPG-TM included 5 domains and 40 items. The items pertain to the development methodology (22 items), Overview of diseases and symptoms (6 items), Recommendations (4 items), Implementation and dissemination (5 items) and others (3 items). Conclusions The completeness of CPG descriptions in TM is very poor. Therefore, a complete description of the recommendations for TM in CPGs is necessary for physicians to implement the recommendations in clinical practice areas. The PRIDE-CPG-TM will provide useful guidance for TM developers in the development of evidence-based CPGs. © 2016 The Author(s)",,10.1016/j.eujim.2016.07.027,,NA,NA,preferred reporting items for the development of evidencebased clinical practice guidelines in traditional medicine pridecpgtm explanation and elaboration

Blood pressure (BP) deviation at rest is well defined and accompanies risk for cardiovascular events and cardiovascular mortality. A growing body of evidence emphasises that an exaggerated blood pressure response (EBPR) in cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) could help to identify seemingly cardiovascular healthy and normotensive subjects, who have an increased risk of developing aHT and cardiovascular events in the future. Materials and methods The PubMed online database was searched for published studies reporting exercise-related BP and both the risk of aHT and cardiovascular events in the future. Results We identified 18 original studies about EBPR in CPET, which included a total of 35,151 normotensive individuals for prediction of new onset of aHT in the future and 11 original studies with 43,012 enrolled subjects with the endpoint of cardiovascular events in the future. Although an EBPR under CPET is not well defined, a large number of studies emphasise that EBPR in CPET is associated with both new-onset aHT and cardiovascular events in the future. Conclusions A growing number of studies support the hypothesis that EBPR in CPET may be a diagnostic tool to identify subjects with an elevated risk of developing aHT and cardiovascular events in the future. © 2017 Medical University of Bialystok",,10.1016/j.advms.2016.11.010,,28511070,NA,impact of exaggerated blood pressure response in normotensive individuals on future hypertension and prognosis systematic review according to prisma guideline

Also, reviews of published systematic reviews have found that key information about these studies is often poorly reported. Realizing these issues, an international group that included experienced authors and methodologists developed PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) as an evolution of the original QUOROM guideline for systematic reviews and meta-analyses of evaluations of health care interventions.

Due to the complexity of non-prismatic geometry, the application domain has been mostly limited to prismatic workpiece fixturing. Moreover, based on the 3-2-1 locating principle, the locators employed are mostly restricted to the cylindrical type. This research focuses on another type of fixture configuration for non-prismatic parts that has been mostly overlooked. This is to apply V-blocks in workholding to ensure stable and efficient work setup of non-prismatic parts. The algorithm presented in this paper determines V-block locating by utilising projected geometric reasoning. The major steps of the algorithm include candidate-point generation, angle and distance checking, co-ordinate transformation, and interference analysis. Further more, this paper also explores another algorithm for determining the corresponding clamping location of the V-block. The horizontal clamp is planned based on static principles. To ensure workpiece stability, the planning procedure is classified into three distinct cases according to the force distribution and frictional conditions at the contacting regions. These two algorithms, V-block locating and clamp planning, are applied interactively to obtain the most desired fixture configuration.

A valid explanation has not been found till now. In the present paper the experimental results of TEM-in situ deformation of single crystal beryllium are presented. Although the samples were oriented to promote prismatic slip, combined slip mechanisms on prismatic and basal planes were observed at room temperature. However, at 170 K plastic deformation only occurred by prismatic slip. A new model explaining the anomaly of the critical resolved shear stress is proposed which is based on elementary dislocation processes, i.e. formation and motion of salient points on dislocation lines.

A side channel carries spatially varied flow with increasing discharge and the water surface profiles within the channel are a main feature of the design process. Usually, the bottom width of the channel is flared in the flow direction. An end sill is also installed at the downstream end of the structure to act as a control section and to provide a desirable flow condition within the channel. In this paper, the results of an experimental program to study the impact of installing such an end sill on flow characteristics in a non-prismatic side channel are presented. Six distinct longitudinal profiles were clearly observed in each experimental run. Two of these profiles comprise the line of the highest and the lowest points of the water surface elevation along the channel. The difference between the heights of these lines was used as a mean to assess the sill effects on the flow characteristics, the 3D water surface, and the energy dissipation of the incoming flow. The results indicated that the difference between the selected longitudinal profiles could be evaluated based on the critical flow depth generated on the end sill installed at the downstream end of the channel. Hence, based on an envelope drawn to the data, a method was proposed to determine the maximum potential impact that an end sill might have on the flow depth, which could be considered as a guideline in the design process.

Owing to the complexity and massive core structure, such analysis requires extensive and massively parallelized computation capabilities and a relatively long time (weeks to months) to complete. These demanding requirements are not due to the 3-D simulation of heat conduction in the annular core of the reactor, but rather the 3-D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation of the helium gas flow in the 10-m long cooling channels in the 102 hexagonal fuel elements and the axial graphite reflector blocks in the core. This paper applies and examines the effectiveness of using a 1-D simulation of the heliun flow in the core coolant channels, coupled to a 3-D simulation of the heat conduction in the graphite and fuel compacts, to perform thermal-hydraulics analysis of a hexagonal fuel element and of a 1/6 full core. This methodology employs typical cosine and constant axial power profiles and an applicable convective heat transfer correlation for the helium flow in the coolant channels. The correlation has recently been validated for a 10 m tall, single channel fuel module and shown to significantly reduce the computation time and memory requirements without compromising the accuracy of the calculations. The fidelity and accuracy of the present results for a hexagonal fuel element are verified by comparing them to those of a full 3-D numerical analysis. In addition to the temperature fields, results compare the computation time and number of numerical grid elements for implementing the two numerical simulation methods. The results of the thermal-hydraulics analysis of a 1/6 full core with the simplified methodology are also presented. All performed analysis accounts for the temperature dependent properties of helium, graphite in the reactor core and reflector blocks and the TRISO particle fuel compacts.",,,,NA,NA,an effective thermalhydraulics methodology for prismatic core htgr and vhtr

Haase"" is based on the assumption that a minute deviation from the orthovergence position (fixation disparity) indicates a difficulty to overcome a larger ""vergence angle of rest"". Objective recordings have, however, revealed that the subjective tests applied in the ""Measuring and Correcting Methodology after H.-J. Haase"" can mislead to the assumption of a fixation disparity, although both eyes are aligned exactly to the fixation point. Question: How do patients with an inconspicuosly small, yet objectively verified strabismus react to the ""Measuring and Correcting Methodology by H.-J. Haase""? Methods: Eight patients with a microesotropia between 0.5 and 3° were subjected to the ""Measuring and Correcting Methodology after H.-J. Haase"". Results: In all 8 patients, the prisms determined with the Cross-, Pointer- and Rectangle Tests increased the angle of squint, without reaching a full correction: the original angle prevailed. In the Stereobalance Test, prisms did not reduce the 100% preponderance of the non-squinting eye. The stereoscopic threshold was between 36 and 1170 arcsec in 7 out of the 8 subjects, and above 4000 arcsec in 1 subject. Conclusions: (1) In all 8 patients, prisms determined with the ""Measuring and Correcting Methodology by H.-J. Haase"" increased the angle of strabismus, without reaching bifoveal vision. This uniform result suggests that primary microesotropia cannot be corrected with the ""Measuring and Correcting Methodology after H.-J.

OHB Sweden is the prime contractor for the project which is funded by the Swedish National Space Board (SNSB) with support from DLR, CNES, and DTU. In early September of 2011, 15 months after launch, all primary mission objectives of the PRISMA formation flying satellites had been achieved and mission success was declared. Since a significant amount of delta-V capability still remained an open call for new experiments was issued, inviting both old and new experimenters to use the capabilities of the formation. Several interested parties took the opportunity to perform their own experiments with an existing platform, each coming with new mission objectives not previously planned to be flown on the PRISMA satellites. Some of these experiments were close to what had already been achieved within the nominal mission, but some included new ways of using the formation not envisioned by the spacecraft designers. The new experiments span from data collection in specific relative orbits, with a separation from a few meters to several kilometers, to entirely new modules within the on-board software. Changing from a pre-planned technology demonstration mission to operating a commercial resource required adaptation of the original operational concept, taking into account the different levels of experience of the customers and managing the satellites between experiments. This paper describes how these new mission objectives were integrated in operations and how a sometimes very short turn-around between initial concept and experiment execution was implemented with the aid of well established validation processes, high degrees of on-board autonomy and a flexible operations team. © 2012 by OHB-Sweden AB.",,10.2514/6.2012-1287986,,NA,NA,prisma mission extension adapting mission operations to new and changing mission objectives

Both inviscid and viscous discretizations are studied using the method of manufactured solutions by systematically varying parameters such as the aspect ratio, mesh stretching, curvature, skewness, and non-planar faces. For the inviscid terms, gradient reconstruction based on cell least squares and nodal Green-Gauss are considered. In particular, high curvature grids are shown to lead to instabilities with both classes of schemes and a new Green-Gauss scheme based on nodal projection is developed that retains stability and formal second-order accuracy under all conditions. A further advantage of the nodal Green-Gauss schemes is that the nodal values can be used in the viscous discretization as well. All the viscous schemes tested here are demonstrated to preserve second-order accuracy. Finally, for three-dimensional prismatic meshes, triangulation of non-planar faces is found to be necessary to preserve second-order accuracy. © 2011 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.",,10.2514/6.2011-3378,,NA,NA,discretization methodology for high aspect ratio prismatic grids

As well as positive outcome studies being preferentially published or followed by full text publication authors are also more likely to publish positive results in English-language journals. This unequal distribution of trials leads to a selection bias in evidence l level studies, like systematic reviews, meta-analysis or health technology assessments followed by a systematic failure of interpretation and in clinical decisions. Publication bias in a systematic review occurs mostly during the selection process and a transparent selection process is necessary to avoid such bias. For systematic reviews/meta-analysis the PRISMA-statement (formerly known as QUOROM) is recommended, as it gives the reader for a better understanding of the selection process. In the future the use of trial registration for minimizing publication bias, mechanisms to allow easier access to the scientific literature and improvement in the peer review process are recommended to overcome publication bias.

Methodology All case reports published in the International Endodontic Journal, European Endodontic Journal, Journal of Endodontics and Restorative Dentistry and Endodontics, in the year before and after the release of PRICE 2020, were included for analysis. Two panels comprising dentists scored case reports against a scoring system adapted from the guideline. Individual items were scored up to a maximum of 1; scores were then summated to provide an overall maximum of 47 for each CR. Each report provided an overall percentage adherence, and panel agreement was calculated using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Disagreement on scoring was discussed until a consensus was reached. Scores before and after PRICE guideline publication were compared using an unpaired two-tailed t test. Results A total 19 CRs were identified in both the pre- and post-PRICE guideline publication. Mean adherence to PRICE 2020 increased by 7.9\% (p=0.003) from 70.0\%+/- 8.89 to 77.9\%+/- 6.23 following its publication. Agreement between panels was moderate (ICC pre-PRICE: 0.673 \{p=0.011\}; ICC post-PRICE: 0.742 \{p=0.003\}).

The guideline development process should be precise and rigorous to ensure that the results are reproducible and not vague. To determine the quality of guidelines, the Appraisal of Guidelines and Research and Evaluation (AGREE) instrument was developed and introduced. The objective of this study is to assess the methodological quality of CPGs on pancreatic cancer. Five databases (included MEDLINE and EMBASE) and guideline websites were searched till April, 2014. The methodological quality of the guidelines was assessed by 4 authors independently using the AGREE II instrument. From 2526 citations, 21 relevant guidelines were included. The overall agreement among reviewers was moderate (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.86, 95\% confidence interval 0.64-0.96). The mean scores were moderate for the domains ``scope and purpose'' and ``clarity of presentation''; however, they were low for the domains ``stakeholder involvement'' (31.22), ``rigor of development'', ``applicability'', and ``editorial independence''. These domain scores were lower when compared with international levels. There are 5 (23.81\%) guidelines that described the systematic methods for searching. Moreover, only 5 (23.81\%) guidelines reported that methodological expertise were included in the guideline developing teams. The quality and transparency of the development process and the consistency in the reporting of pancreatic cancer guidelines need to be improved. Many other methodological disadvantages were identified. In the future, pancreatic cancer CPGs should base on the best available evidence rigorously developed and reported.

A systematic review was performed, following the PRISMA guidelines, of the empirical studies found in PubMed and ScienceDirect, a total of 18 studies being included altogether. Results and conclusions. The results consistently point to the implication of two opposing neural systems in this bias: one appetitive, involving the striatum and the frontal regions, and one aversive, involving the amygdala and the insula, which interact with each other when it comes to making a decision about different monetary bets and display a higher sensitivity towards losses.

Methods: According to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement, a search was performed in PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) for eligible studies from inception to October 2018. Hazard ratios (HRs) and corresponding 95\% confidence intervals (Cis) were used to assess the strength of association. All data were analyzed with statistical software Stata 12.0. Results: Based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, 28 retrospective cohort studies, assessing 38,786 samples, were further analyzed. Results showed that EPE was associated with higher BCR risk, according to both univariate analysis (pooled HR=1.69, 95\% CI: 1.55-1.85, p<0.001) and multivariate analysis (pooled HR=1.27, 95\% CI: 1.19-1.35, p<0.001).

Here, we performed this study to evaluate the prognostic significance of GSTP1, p16, ESR1, and PITX2 promoter methylation in breast cancer. Methods: A range of online databases was systematically searched to identify available studies based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline. The pooled hazard ratios (HRs) with their 95\% confidence intervals (95\% CIs) were applied to estimate the prognostic effect of GSTP1, p16, ESR1, and PITX2 promoter methylation in breast cancer for multivariate regression analysis. Results: 13 eligible articles involving 3915 patients with breast cancer were analyzed in this meta-analysis. In a large patient population, GSTP1 showed a trend toward a worse prognosis in overall survival (OS) (HR=1.64, 95\% CI=0.93-2.87, P=.085). PITX2 promoter methylation was significantly correlated with a worse prognosis in OS (HR=1.57,95\% CI=1.15-2.14, P=.004), but no association between p16 promoter methylation and OS (HR= 0.92, 95\% CI=0.31-2.71, P=.884).

The expression of the P16 was not associated with clinical outcomes in overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) by multivariate analysis (OS: P = .448; DFS: P = .263). Conclusions: The use of P16 expression could become a promising predictive biomarker of the response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in the white population with high-grade osteosarcoma.

However, the clinical significance of APC promoter methylation in HCC remains unclear. This meta-analysis was conducted to assess the relationship between APC promoter methylation and clinicopathological characteristics of patients with HCC. Methods: Eligible publications were identified by online electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, EBSCO and the Cochrane Library). The combined odds ratios (ORs) with their corresponding 95\% confidence intervals (95\% CIs) were calculated and summarized under the random-effects model. Results: Final 21 available studies were included in the current study. APC promoter methylation was significantly higher in HCC than in normal live tissues, liver cirrhosis, and healthy blood samples (OR =11.46, P<0.001; OR =6.04, P<0.001; OR =93.83, P<0.001;respectively).

A fully recursive literature search of the primary electronic data-bases for available trials was performed. The objective response rate (ORR) and the median progression-free survival (PFS) of clinical responses were considered the main endpoints to evaluate the efficacy, whereas Grade 3-4 adverse effects (AEs) were analyzed to evaluate safety. The ORR of PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors was 30\% (95\% CI: 25-35\%). No significant difference in the ORR was observed after the comparisons of low-dose, median-dose, and high-dose cohorts. In addition, the rate of Grade 3-4 AEs was 9\% (95\% CI: 6-12\%). According to the 3 randomized controlled trials that compared PD-1 inhibitors with chemotherapy, the difference between these 2 groups was found to be statistically significant with respect to the ORR, PFS and the incidence of Grade 3-4 AEs; that is, the relative risk (RR) of the ORR was 3.42 (95\% CI: 2.49-4.69, P< 0.001), the hazard ratio (HR) of the PFS was 0.50 (95\% CI: 0.44-0.58, P< 0.001), and the RR of Grade 3-4 AEs was 0.45 (95\% CI: 0.31-0.65, P< 0.001).

However, increasing evidence indicates that the safety of bupropion in BD patients may not be as good as previously thought. The aim of this study was to summarize data on the treatment effect and safety profile of bupropion in the treatment of BD via a meta-analysis. Electronic search through PubMed and ClinicalTrials.gov was performed. The inclusion criteria were: (i) studies comparing changes in disease severity before and after bupropion treatment or articles comparing the treatment effect of bupropion in BD patients with those receiving other standard treatments; (ii) articles on clinical trials in humans. The exclusion criteria were (i) case reports/series, and (ii) nonclinical trials. All effect sizes from 10 clinical trials were pooled using a random effects model. We examined the possible confounding variables using meta-regression and subgroup analysis. Bupropion significantly improved the severity of disease in BD patients (P<0.001), and the treatment effect was similar to other antidepressants/standard treatments (P=0.220). There were no significant differences in the dropout rate (P=0.285) and rate of phase shifting (P=0.952) between BD patients who received bupropion and those who received other antidepressants. We could not perform a detailed meta-analysis of every category of antidepressant, nor could we rule out the possible confounding effect of concurrent psychotropics or include all drug side effects. Furthermore, the number of studies recruited in the meta-analysis was relatively small. Our findings reconfirm the benefits of bupropion for the treatment of bipolar depression, which are similar to those of other antidepressants. However, the rate of phase shifting with bupropion usage was not as low compared to other antidepressants as previously thought, which should serve to remind clinicians of the risk of phase shifting when prescribing bupropion to BD patients regardless of the suggestions of current clinical practice guidelines.",,10.1097/MD.0000000000003165,,NA,NA,significant treatment effect of bupropion in patients with bipolar disorder but similar phaseshifting rate as other antidepressants <i>a metaanalysis following the prisma guidelines<i>

Haase,2006,1,NA,KLINISCHE MONATSBLATTER FUR AUGENHEILKUNDE,0023-2165,223,1,29-35,"Kromeier, M and Kommerell, G",NA,German,GEORG THIEME VERLAG KG,"RUDIGERSTR 14, D-70469 STUTTGART, GERMANY","Background: The ``Measuring and Correcting Methodology after H.-J. Haase{''} is based on the assumption that a minute deviation from the orthovergence position (fixation disparity) indicates a difficulty to overcome a larger ``vergence angle of rest{''}. Objective recordings have, however, revealed that the subjective tests applied in the ``Measuring and Correcting Methodology after H.-J. Haase{''} can mislead to the assumption of a fixation disparity, although both eyes are aligned exactly to the fixation point. Question: How do patients with an inconspicuously small, yet objectively verified strabismus react to the ``Measuring and Correcting Methodology by H.-J. Haase{''}? Methods: Eight patients with a microesotropia between 0.5 and 3 degrees were subjected to the ``Measuring and Correcting Methodology after H.-J. Haase. Results: In all 8 patients, the prisms determined with the Cross-, Pointer- and Rectangle Tests increased the angle of squint, without reaching a full correction: the original angle prevailed. In the Stereobalance Test, prisms did not reduce the 100\% preponderance of the non-squinting eye. The stereoscopic threshold was between 36 and 1170 arcsec in 7 out of the 8 subjects, and above 4000 arcsec in 1 subject. Conclusions: (1) In all 8 patients, prisms determined with the ``Measuring and Correcting Methodology by H.-J. Haase{''} increased the angle of strabismus, without reaching bifoveal vision. This uniform result suggests that primary microesotropia cannot be corrected with the ``Measuring and Correcting Methodology after H.-J. Haase{''} (2) A lacking contribution of the strabismic eye to the recognition of a lateral off-set between stereo objects, as determined with the Stereobalance Test, does not imply a lack of binocular stereopsis.",,10.1055/s-2005-858865,microstrabismus; heterophoria; fixation disparity; associated phoria; measuring and correcting me...,NA,NA,feasibility of prismatic correction of microesotropia using the measuring and correcting methodology by hj haase
